## Goal

Make CodeGraph readiness part of the `agentic-dev` CLI and doctor surface without overloading the host-hook installer target model.

The planned product boundary is:

- `agentic-dev install --target codex|claude|both` remains host-adapter installation only.
- `agentic-dev tools ensure codegraph` owns CodeGraph dependency, index, and local readiness mutation.
- `agentic-dev doctor` reports CodeGraph readiness read-only and prints remediation commands.
- The existing `scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh` CodeGraph detector is migrated or wrapped so there is one authoritative readiness implementation.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Vendor `@colbymchenry/codegraph` for this repo as a dev dependency.
  - Add a `tools ensure codegraph` CLI path and thin `scripts/ensure-codegraph.sh` adapter.
  - Preserve local-first resolution: `node_modules/.bin/codegraph` before global fallback.
  - Keep MCP config mutation out of default `ensure` and all `doctor` flows.
  - Update generated policy/template/test surfaces so they either reflect vendored CodeGraph for this repo or explicitly preserve non-vendored downstream defaults.
  - Add tests for local/global/missing/drift/offline/index/MCP non-mutation paths.
- Out of scope:
  - Auto-writing Codex or Claude MCP config to a repo-local CodeGraph binary.
  - Vendoring gbrain, sentrux, Waza, gstack, or other tools.
  - Removing or killing global CodeGraph installs or daemons.
  - Changing `agentic-dev install --target` semantics.
  - Starting hook-global-runtime Phase 1 CLI implementation from this contract.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260528-1652-codegraph-readiness.md`
- Todo projection: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/codegraph-readiness.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/codegraph-readiness.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass and the review recommend pass.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: `agentic-dev tools ensure codegraph` owns CodeGraph lifecycle mutation; `agentic-dev doctor` reports CodeGraph readiness through `checkCodegraph()` without mutating dependencies, index state, daemon state, or MCP config.
- Edge cases: local binary wins over global fallback; global fallback is reported with remediation; stale/missing index and MCP gaps remain explicit remediation states.
- Regression risks: any future tool readiness command must keep `agentic-dev install --target` host-only and reuse the shared tooling detector rather than introducing a second CodeGraph readiness model.
- Manual acceptance covered by tests/review: doctor read-only behavior, default ensure MCP non-mutation, local-first binary resolution, and downstream global-CodeGraph compatibility.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: current working tree before the CodeGraph readiness closeout commit.
- Revert strategy: revert the closeout commit; dependency + detector slice from `ff139b2` can remain independently valid if CLI registration must be backed out.
