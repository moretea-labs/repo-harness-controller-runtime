## Goal

Add a repo-local heartbeat triage runner that can be invoked by cron/loop, writes `.ai/harness/triage/inbox.md`, records one entry each for workflow health, sprint next task, and pending architecture drift requests, and documents the scheduler contract without installing a persistent scheduler.

## Scope

- In scope: `scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh`, distributed helper parity, triage runtime surface/ignore contract, focused tests, and scheduler documentation.
- Out of scope: installing launchd/crontab jobs, autonomous task execution, child-agent spawning, PR creation, heartbeat adoption analytics beyond a scheduled review note, or changing hook dispatch.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260612-1312-loop-engine-06-heartbeat-v0.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260612-1312-loop-engine-06-heartbeat-v0.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260612-1312-loop-engine-06-heartbeat-v0.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

      pattern: "Adoption review"
  qa_scores:
    - dimension: functionality
      min: 7
  manual_checks:
    - "Evaluator review file recommends pass"
```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: `scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh run` writes append-only inbox entries plus JSON run snapshots for workflow health, sprint-next, and architecture drift requests; three scheduled proof runs produced all three entry classes.
- Edge cases: workflow-check failures become inbox findings while the runner exits 0; no active sprint marker falls back to a read-only sprint-file scan.
- Regression risks: persistent scheduling is intentionally not installed by repo code, so adoption depends on a host-local cron/loop wrapper after the two-week review.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: row6 branch `codex/loop-engine-06-heartbeat-v0-clean` before finish commit.
- Revert strategy: revert the row6 commit to remove the heartbeat helper, docs, manifest/template registration, tests, and tracked triage directory placeholder; runtime inbox/run snapshots are ignored state.
