## Goal

Deliver a `repo-harness capability-context` CLI plus hook queue flow that creates and refreshes capability-local paired `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files from the explicit capability registry, without spawning LLM agents from `PostEdit`.

## Scope

- In scope: CLI `status`, `request`, and `sync`; controlled `CAPABILITY CONTEXT` block rendering; `.ai/context/capability-source-map.json` fallback manifest; ignored `.ai/harness/capability-context/` queue; `PostEdit` enqueue; `SessionStart` reminder; generated/self-host hook parity; tests and docs.
- Out of scope: background LLM spawning from hooks, broad physical-layout inference, replacing the existing architecture contract block, and authoring semantic architecture snapshots.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260529-0004-capability-context-cli-hook.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/capability-context-cli-hook.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/capability-context-cli-hook.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass and the review recommend pass.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior: `repo-harness capability-context sync --pending --apply` writes paired local context files, preserves manual content, normalizes registry contract files, and clears processed queue requests.
- Edge cases: file prefixes target their containing directory; root capability stays at root; dry-run does not write; missing manifest entries fall back to deterministic registry-derived content.
- Regression risks: hook output must stay advisory and synchronous; generated `assets/hooks` and self-host `.ai/hooks` must stay in parity.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: branch `codex/capability-context-cli-hook`.
- Revert strategy: revert this branch; runtime queue state under `.ai/harness/capability-context/` is ignored and can be deleted independently.
