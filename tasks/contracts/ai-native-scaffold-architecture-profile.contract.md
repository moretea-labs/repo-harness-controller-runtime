## Goal

Add an AI-native scaffold profile overlay to `repo-harness-scaffold` without changing the canonical A-K plan catalog. The slice must let generated output stay unchanged by default, while explicitly selected AI-native profiles document runtime, UI protocol, sidecar, state, contract, and observability boundaries.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Add `ai_native_profile` metadata and profile definitions to initializer question pack v4.
  - Add per-plan AI-native overlay recommendations to `assets/plan-map.json` while preserving A-K plan codes.
  - Wire profile variables through template assembly and generated scaffold guidance.
  - Add generated structure overlays for `runtime-console`, `product-copilot`, and `sidecar-kernel`.
  - Update scaffold-facing docs and tests.
- Out of scope:
  - Adding another lettered plan code or changing A-K meanings.
  - Installing concrete model providers, API keys, cloud tracing accounts, or deployment platforms.
  - Generating Python, Go, and Rust services by default.
  - Making A2UI the production-default UI layer.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260531-0032-ai-native-scaffold-architecture-profile.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/ai-native-scaffold-architecture-profile.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/ai-native-scaffold-architecture-profile.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass and the review recommend pass.

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
  - Default generated Plan C output does not include AI-native profile prose.
  - Explicit `AI_NATIVE_PROFILE=runtime-console` output includes AG-UI, assistant-ui, Bun/Hono, state, contracts, observability, and A2UI-as-optional language.
- Edge cases:
  - Unknown profile IDs fail fast.
  - Plan D sidecar policy keeps Python/Go/Rust behind MCP/HTTP boundaries.
- Regression risks:
  - Existing A-K plan labels and default scaffold structure must remain unchanged.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: branch `codex/ai-native-scaffold-architecture-profile`
- Revert strategy: revert this branch or remove the profile metadata, overlay files, template wiring, and tests named in allowed paths.
