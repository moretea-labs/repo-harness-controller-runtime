## Goal

Deliver the architecture freshness gate surfaces: a root check command that
validates architecture queue index integrity and gates only changed capabilities
with pending request cards, plus finish/session-start/package/docs wiring.

## Scope

- In scope:
- `scripts/check-architecture-sync.sh` and its template copy.
- `scripts/capability-resolver.ts` batch `match --paths-from <file|->` support.
- `scripts/contract-worktree.sh finish` orchestration before `verify-sprint`.
- SessionStart architecture queue summary in `.ai/hooks` and `assets/hooks`.
- Root required-check/docs/package surfaces and focused tests.
- Out of scope:
- Enabling strict freshness by default; policy remains advisory unless explicitly changed.
- Slice 3 downstream retired-removal rollout beyond the helper/template parity required for this slice.
- Automatic architecture prose/diagram generation.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260612-0410-arch-doc-loop-02-freshness-gate-surfaces.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260612-0410-arch-doc-loop-02-freshness-gate-surfaces.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260612-0410-arch-doc-loop-02-freshness-gate-surfaces.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
- `contract-worktree.sh finish` calls `check_architecture_freshness` before
  `verify-sprint`.
- `check-architecture-sync.sh` always fails stale derived index state, even when
  freshness mode is off.
- `off`, `advisory`, and `strict` modes are deterministic and tested.
- SessionStart reports pending architecture drift count and oldest age.
- Edge cases:
- Missing resolver/queue dependencies are advisory in advisory mode and
  fail-closed in strict mode.
- Regression risks:
- `verify-sprint` and migration/scaffold helpers must keep passing after the new
  required check is added.
