## Goal

Add a repo-local `contract-run` helper that runs a contract package through explicit worker and verifier child commands, enforces the contract budget before spawning children, and records a run manifest suitable for the next delegation pilot.

## Scope

- In scope: `scripts/contract-run.ts`, distributed helper parity, workflow manifest/install surfaces, tests for worker/verifier orchestration and budget overrun, and row 5 review/notes/sprint evidence.
- Out of scope: unattended scheduler/heartbeat, hook dispatch changes, real provider-specific Claude/Codex spawning defaults, multi-candidate search, or replacing `contract-worktree.sh finish`.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260612-1239-loop-engine-05-contract-run-pilot.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260612-1239-loop-engine-05-contract-run-pilot.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260612-1239-loop-engine-05-contract-run-pilot.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.
