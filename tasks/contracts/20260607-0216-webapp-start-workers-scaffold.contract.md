## Goal

Update repo-harness scaffold guidance so SEO/SSR React webapps use a single TanStack Start + Vite + Cloudflare Workers frontend deployment by default, while client-only Vite and legacy marketing/static surfaces remain explicit opt-in or rollback choices.

## Scope

- In scope:
  - Plan B/C/D/E stack-family metadata and generated project-structure guidance.
  - Initializer question-pack metadata for the webapp rendering/deployment model.
  - Template assembly variables and Cloudflare/docs output that distinguish Workers SSR from Pages/static deploy.
  - Regression tests proving one `apps/web` frontend, `/` SSR/public route, `/app` client-only boundary, and no default two-frontend scaffold.
- Out of scope:
  - Implementing or migrating Salesko.
  - Adding a new A-K plan code.
  - Running real Cloudflare deploys or adding provider/auth secrets.
  - Retiring existing legacy marketing docs except where generated-default wording must be corrected.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260607-0216-webapp-start-workers-scaffold.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260607-0216-webapp-start-workers-scaffold.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260607-0216-webapp-start-workers-scaffold.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.
