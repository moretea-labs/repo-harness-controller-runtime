## Goal

Complete the first architecture-doc-loop slice in this isolated worktree:
replace the one-shot architecture drift writer with a queue CLI that owns
record/status/reindex/triage/check, keeps PostToolUse advisory-only, and clears
the pre-2026-06-01 legacy architecture request backlog.

## Scope

- In scope:
- `scripts/architecture-queue.sh` and the `scripts/architecture-event.ts`
  request merge/render helpers it uses.
- Removing the old `scripts/architecture-drift.sh` runtime entrypoint from this
  self-host repo and replacing runtime/test/contract references with the queue.
- `.ai/hooks` and `assets/hooks` post-edit guard parity for queue record calls.
- Queue policy keys, self-host/template workflow required-file checks, helper
  inventory, and focused tests required so removing `architecture-drift.sh`
  does not break generated repos.
- Legacy request triage for requests before 2026-06-01 and the resolution pass
  needed to leave `docs/architecture/requests/` pending-only and empty.
- Out of scope:
- `loop-engine-01` files already committed on primary/main.
- Slice 2 strict finish gate surfaces and new `check-architecture-sync.sh`.
- Slice 3 full downstream migration/retired-removal rollout beyond the helper
  inventory and scaffold parity needed by this slice.
- Slice 4 research surface migration.

## Workflow Inventory

- Source plan: `plans/plan-20260612-0318-arch-doc-loop-01-queue-engine-triage.md`
- Deferred-goal ledger: `tasks/todo.md`
- Review file: `tasks/reviews/20260612-0318-arch-doc-loop-01-queue-engine-triage.review.md`
- Notes file: `tasks/notes/20260612-0318-arch-doc-loop-01-queue-engine-triage.notes.md`
- Checks file: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`
- Run snapshots: `.ai/harness/runs/`
- Scope gate: edit only paths listed under `allowed_paths`; update this contract before widening scope.
- Completion gate: `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` must see this contract pass, the review recommend pass, and `## External Acceptance Advice` pass or record a manual override.

```

## Acceptance Notes (Human Review)

- Functional behavior:
- `architecture-queue.sh record` preserves the `[ArchitectureDrift] Request:`
  stdout prefix for existing PostToolUse orchestration.
- `architecture-queue.sh reindex --check` derives the pending block from
  `docs/architecture/requests/` instead of appending ad hoc lines.
- `architecture-queue.sh triage --before 2026-06-01` groups the historical
  backlog into capability cards and archives superseded legacy requests.
- The implementation completed the planned resolve pass after triage, so the
  root request directory is now empty and the controlled pending block renders
  `- (none)`.
- Edge cases:
- `record` is advisory if Bun is missing; strict queue/check behavior must fail
  closed when required dependencies are missing.
- Regression risks:
- Helper inventory tests and self-migration checks still reference old helper
  names; replace only the self-host surfaces required for this slice.

## Rollback Point

- Commit / checkpoint: branch `codex/arch-doc-loop-01-queue-engine-triage`
  before finish/merge.
- Revert strategy: revert the eventual queue-engine commit, restoring
  `architecture-drift.sh`, removing `architecture-queue.sh`, and moving archived
  request cards back only if a historical pending backlog needs to be replayed.
