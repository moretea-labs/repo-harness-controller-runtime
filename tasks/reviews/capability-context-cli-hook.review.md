## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: user-approved plan implementation in isolated worktree `codex/capability-context-cli-hook`.
- P1 map: capability registry remains the authority; hook runtime stays under `.ai/hooks`/`assets/hooks`; CLI owns semantic context block rendering.
- P2 trace: `PostEdit` architecture drift event enqueues `.ai/harness/capability-context/requests.jsonl`; `SessionStart` injects the pending reminder; `repo-harness capability-context sync --pending --apply` writes paired local context files and clears processed queue entries.
- P3 decision rationale: hooks remain synchronous and zero-LLM; `--auto-fill-positioning` is explicit and deterministic, so hidden quota/PATH/concurrency dependencies do not enter edit hooks.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: local review equivalent completed in this file after full verification.
- Commands run: `bun test`; `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`; `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`; `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`; `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`; `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`.
- Manual checks: `repo-harness capability-context status --json` reports registry status and target contract paths; hook-runtime tests cover queue and SessionStart behavior.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `tests/cli/capability-context.test.ts`, `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: `tasks/notes/capability-context-cli-hook.notes.md`.
- Run snapshot: pending `verify-sprint` refresh.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Added CLI subcommand `capability-context` with `status`, `request`, and `sync`.
- Added tracked `.ai/context/capability-source-map.json` manifest and ignored `.ai/harness/capability-context/` queue surface.
- Updated self-host and generated hook assets in parity: `PostEdit` enqueues requests; `SessionStart` reminds but does not execute sync or spawn agents.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- No required follow-up. The explicit sidecar LLM path remains deliberately unimplemented until there is a stable host-agnostic agent exec contract.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | CLI, queue, sync, registry normalization, manifest fallback, and hook reminders are covered by tests. |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Keeps context savings explicit and avoids hidden hook-time LLM cost. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Preserves existing architecture/context-contract split and works with generated/self-host parity. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Focused TypeScript command body, shell hook changes, and regression coverage across CLI/hooks/scaffold. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test`
- Re-check: `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`

## Summary

- Pass. The implementation satisfies the approved plan without moving LLM execution into hooks.
