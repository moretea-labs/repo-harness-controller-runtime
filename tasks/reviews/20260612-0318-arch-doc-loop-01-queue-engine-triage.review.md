## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: repo-harness contract worktree execution in `/Users/chris/Projects/agentic-dev-wt-arch-doc-loop-01-queue-engine-triage`.
- P1 map: host adapter stays thin; PostToolUse edit route calls `.ai/hooks/post-edit-guard.sh`; post-edit now delegates architecture request ownership to `scripts/architecture-queue.sh`; `scripts/architecture-event.ts` owns card rendering and index derivation.
- P2 trace: edit/write event -> post-edit guard -> `architecture-queue.sh record` -> capability resolver -> `architecture-event.ts upsert-request` -> per-capability request card and events JSONL -> `architecture-queue.sh reindex` derives the controlled pending block in `docs/architecture/index.md`.
- P3 decision rationale: keep hook execution advisory and cheap; move mutable request/card/index state into a repo-local queue CLI; keep hard freshness enforcement for later finish/check gates.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: local equivalent review recorded here after full repo verification.
- Commands run:
  - `bun test tests/hook-contracts.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`
  - `bun test tests/architecture-queue.test.ts tests/architecture-event.test.ts`
  - `bun test tests/bootstrap-files.test.ts tests/create-project-dirs.runtime.test.ts tests/workflow-contract.test.ts tests/scaffold-parity.test.ts tests/migration-script.test.ts tests/helper-scripts.test.ts`
  - `bash scripts/architecture-queue.sh reindex --check`
  - `bash scripts/architecture-queue.sh check`
  - `bash scripts/architecture-queue.sh status --format summary`
  - `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`
  - `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`
  - `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`
  - `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`
  - `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`
  - `bun test`
- Manual checks:
  - `docs/architecture/index.md` pending block is controlled and reports `- (none)`.
  - `docs/architecture/requests/` has no root-level pending request files.
  - `docs/architecture/requests/archive/2026/` contains the legacy and resolved derived request cards.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`, `tests/architecture-queue.test.ts`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: `tasks/notes/20260612-0318-arch-doc-loop-01-queue-engine-triage.notes.md`.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` records the latest `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh` run and points to the immutable run file.

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: manual_override
> **External Reviewer**: user
> **External Source**: direct-approval
> **External Started**: 2026-06-12 03:18
> **External Completed**: 2026-06-12 03:46

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories: independent external reviewer was not run in this slice; acceptance relies on user approval plus full local verification.
- Acceptance checklist: queue engine behavior, hook parity, helper inventory, real backlog cleanup, scaffold/migration parity, and root required checks passed.
- Manual Override: User explicitly approved continuing this execution path; no separate cross-agent external review was available.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- `architecture-drift.sh` is retired from the self-host runtime surface and replaced by `architecture-queue.sh`.
- Post-edit hook behavior remains advisory and preserves the `[ArchitectureDrift] Request:` stdout prefix.
- Queue state is now derived from pending request cards instead of append-only index lines.
- Legacy pre-2026-06-01 architecture requests were archived; the root pending queue is empty.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Slice 2 still needs the finish-time freshness gate and session-start summary surface.
- The queue gate is advisory in policy; strict mode is implemented and tested but not enabled for normal finish flow yet.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Required queue commands, hook delegation, cleanup, and root checks pass. |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Slice stays bounded to queue ownership and cleanup; strict rollout is intentionally deferred. |
| Design quality | 8/10 | State ownership moved out of the hot hook path without changing host adapter boundaries. |
| Code quality | 8/10 | Focused queue tests plus full suite passed; remaining risk is rollout surface in later slices. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test`
- Re-check: `bash scripts/architecture-queue.sh reindex --check && bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`

## Summary

- Pass. The queue engine slice is implemented, verified, and ready for contract verification/finish.
