## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: focused hook UX repair after `/hunt` root-cause trace.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: P1 - `$think` planning creates `.ai/harness/planning/pending.json`, Stop owns one-shot completion gating, `scripts/capture-plan.sh` owns `plans/` capture, and `assets/hooks` mirrors installed runtime. P2 - pending planning plus plan-like assistant output reaches Stop, records a signature, and blocks once; the patch changes only the block reason text. P3 - keep the guard, reject auto-capture from Stop, and make the next action explicit.
- Root cause or plan evidence: the previous generic self-review message obscured the real next action: capture complete planning output into `plans/` or revise once before capture.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: not run; this review records the focused local check for a two-file hook message change plus test assertions.
- Commands run:
  - `bash -n .ai/hooks/stop-orchestrator.sh assets/hooks/stop-orchestrator.sh`
  - `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts -t "post-edit-guard: records architecture drift and syncs local context contract blocks"`
  - `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts -t "stop-orchestrator: blocks once to force pending plan completeness review"`
  - `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts -t "stop-orchestrator: skips recursive Stop continuations and supports Codex block JSON"`
  - `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`
  - `cmp -s .ai/hooks/stop-orchestrator.sh assets/hooks/stop-orchestrator.sh`
  - `bash scripts/verify-contract.sh --contract tasks/contracts/20260613-0327-plan-completeness-gate-ux-contract.contract.md --strict`
  - `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`
- Manual checks: diff review confirms `should_run_plan_completeness_gate` conditions, signature recording, and second-Stop suppression are unchanged.
- Supporting artifacts: `tasks/notes/20260613-0327-plan-completeness-gate-ux-contract.notes.md`
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes
- Run snapshot: not generated; full hook-runtime suite passed with 104 tests.

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: manual_override
> **External Reviewer**: none
> **External Source**: focused local verification
> **External Started**: 2026-06-13 03:27 +0800
> **External Completed**: 2026-06-13 03:32 +0800

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories: none for the scoped checks. The previous full-suite failure was traced to linked-worktree dependency resolution (`commander` missing when a hook subprocess executed `src/cli/index.ts`) and fixed in the test harness.
- Manual Override: external `/check` was not run; the scoped finish gate is satisfied by local contract verification, full `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` passing 104/104, hook asset parity, and strict workflow verification.
- Acceptance checklist: first Stop block includes concrete capture guidance; recursive Stop still skips; one-shot behavior still suppresses the second Stop block; runtime/assets copies are in parity.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- `PlanCompletenessGate` still blocks once for fresh pending planning output, but the reason now says to capture a complete plan with `scripts/capture-plan.sh` and includes the derived `--slug`, `--source`, `--orchestration-kind`, and optional `--source-ref`.
- The previous generic "Before stopping, run one self-review pass" wording is removed from the tested path.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Full root required checks were not all run in this focused slice.
- The guidance command is display-only; the agent must still substitute the actual final plan body.
- Default-brain mirror state is external to git; after full hook-runtime verification, `docs/reference-configs/harness-overview.md` was re-synced with `scripts/sync-brain-docs.sh --changed` before `check-task-workflow --strict`.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 8/10 | Focused behavior and full hook-runtime suite covered. |
| Product depth | 7/10 | Addresses the observed interruption without changing workflow semantics. |
| Design quality | 8/10 | Keeps source-of-truth invariant and avoids Stop-side auto-capture. |
| Code quality | 8/10 | Small Bash helper, mirrored asset, and targeted assertions. |

## Failing Items

- None from focused verification.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`
- Re-check: `cmp -s .ai/hooks/stop-orchestrator.sh assets/hooks/stop-orchestrator.sh`

## Summary

- Pass for the scoped UX contract. The patch makes the Stop interruption actionable while preserving the guard and one-shot behavior.
