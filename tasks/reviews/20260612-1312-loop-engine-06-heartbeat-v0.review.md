## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: contract slice from loop-engine sprint row 6.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: the repo already has reactive checks and maintenance triage, but no scheduled discovery surface. The correct boundary is a repo-local runner that writes runtime inbox state; scheduler installation remains manual and host-local.
- Root cause or plan evidence: the sprint research identified heartbeat/automations as the missing Loop Engineering component.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: local contract review equivalent completed in this review file.
- Commands run:
  - `bun test tests/heartbeat-triage.test.ts`
  - `bun test tests/heartbeat-triage.test.ts tests/bootstrap-files.test.ts tests/migration-script.test.ts tests/scaffold-parity.test.ts tests/workflow-contract.test.ts tests/create-project-dirs.runtime.test.ts`
  - `bash scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh run --source scheduled --run-id row6-scheduled-1 --json`
  - `bash scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh run --source scheduled --run-id row6-scheduled-2 --json`
  - `bash scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh run --source scheduled --run-id row6-scheduled-3 --json`
  - `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`
  - `REPO_HARNESS_BRAIN_ROOT=$PWD/.ai/harness/runs/row6-brain-vault bash scripts/verify-contract.sh --contract tasks/contracts/20260612-1312-loop-engine-06-heartbeat-v0.contract.md --strict --read-only`
- Manual checks:
  - Three scheduled proof runs appended entries to `.ai/harness/triage/inbox.md`.
  - Each run recorded `workflow-check`, `sprint-next`, and `drift-requests`.
  - The proof runs surfaced real BrainSync drift before it was fixed, validating that heartbeat produces actionable findings rather than only happy-path noise.
  - `docs/reference-configs/heartbeat-triage.md` documents cron and loop usage without installing a scheduler.
  - The final contract gate used a complete worktree-local brain vault copy because the default iCloud brain vault is shared by concurrent worktrees.
- Supporting artifacts:
  - `scripts/heartbeat-triage.sh`
  - `assets/templates/helpers/heartbeat-triage.sh`
  - `docs/reference-configs/heartbeat-triage.md`
  - `assets/reference-configs/heartbeat-triage.md`
  - `.ai/harness/triage/.gitkeep`
- Implementation notes reviewed: `tasks/notes/20260612-1312-loop-engine-06-heartbeat-v0.notes.md`
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`

## Execution Log

| When | Event | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2026-06-12 13:25 +0800 | scheduled proof run 1 | wrote inbox entries; workflow-check found BrainSync drift; sprint-next identified row 6; drift-requests found 27 pending requests |
| 2026-06-12 13:25 +0800 | scheduled proof run 2 | wrote the same three entry classes |
| 2026-06-12 13:25 +0800 | scheduled proof run 3 | wrote the same three entry classes |
| 2026-06-26 | adoption review scheduled | review whether inbox items produced human-accepted follow-up work; if no adoption, keep runner on-demand and do not install a scheduler |

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: Codex
> **External Source**: codex-review
> **External Started**: 2026-06-12 13:12 +0800
> **External Completed**: 2026-06-12 13:26 +0800

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories: do not auto-install cron/launchd from repo code; scheduler setup is documented for manual host-local use.
- Acceptance checklist: pass; runner writes the inbox, three scheduled proof runs produced entries, cron/loop docs exist, and the two-week adoption review is scheduled for 2026-06-26.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Adds a new helper and distributed asset copy.
- Adds `.ai/harness/triage/` as runtime state with tracked `.gitkeep` only.
- Adds heartbeat reference docs to the minimal reference-config set.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Adoption is unproven until the 2026-06-26 review window. If no inbox item is accepted, do not install a persistent scheduler.
- The runner lists architecture requests but does not classify or auto-resolve them.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 8/10 | Meets heartbeat inbox, scheduled proof, docs, and adoption-review requirements. |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Produces actual triage findings from workflow, sprint, and drift surfaces. |
| Design quality | 8/10 | Keeps scheduler persistence manual and preserves normal plan/contract authority. |
| Code quality | 8/10 | Covered by temp-repo runner tests plus manifest/install parity tests. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/heartbeat-triage.test.ts`.
- Re-check: `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`.

## Summary

- Pass. Row 6 adds a safe heartbeat triage runner and documents scheduler usage without turning unattended discovery into unattended execution.
