## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: Waza `/think` captured plan, then contract worktree execution.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan records hook authority boundaries, PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit trace, and the soft-advisory state-machine decision.
- Root cause or plan evidence: CodeGraph readiness existed, but discovery discipline was documentation-driven; this slice adds runtime feedback without route or adapter churn.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: local review performed against diff, contract, focused tests, full tests, and manual smoke evidence.
- Commands run:
  - `bash -n .ai/hooks/lib/session-state.sh .ai/hooks/trace-event.sh .ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh .ai/hooks/post-bash.sh assets/hooks/lib/session-state.sh assets/hooks/trace-event.sh assets/hooks/prompt-guard.sh assets/hooks/post-bash.sh`
  - `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts tests/hook-contracts.test.ts tests/hook-protocol.test.ts tests/scaffold-parity.test.ts tests/output-parity.test.ts`
  - `bun test tests/cli/codegraph.test.ts tests/tooling/codegraph-integration.test.ts`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `bun test`
  - `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`
  - `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`
  - `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`
  - `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`
  - `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`
- Manual checks:
  - `prompt-guard.sh` emits one CodeGraphRoute nudge for a non-trivial hook debugging prompt, then stays silent for the same session after `.nudged`.
  - `trace-event.sh` records `.claude/.codegraph-state/used_.used` for `HOOK_TOOL_NAME=mcp__codegraph__codegraph_context`.
  - `post-bash.sh` records `broad_command: true`, `output_line_count: 2`, and `recommended_next_tool: codegraph_context` for `rg foo` without blocking.
- Supporting artifacts: `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`, and `tasks/notes/think-users-ancienttwo-agents-skillsthink-skill-md.notes.md`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes.
- Run snapshot: produced by `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh` after this review update.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Non-trivial code prompts now get at most one session-local CodeGraph nudge.
- Observed CodeGraph tool calls mark the session used and silence future nudges.
- Broad shell exploration remains allowed; post-bash evidence now records conservative scope metadata.
- `.ai/hooks` and `assets/hooks` remain mirrored; no route registry or host adapter shape changed.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Broad Bash classification is intentionally conservative and evidence-only; false positives do not block work.
- If future tool-name normalization changes, CodeGraph usage marker coverage should be rechecked.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Covers one-shot nudge, used-marker silence, prompt carve-outs, and Bash metadata. |
| Product depth | 9/10 | Optimizes agent efficiency and evidence quality without making token reduction the KPI. |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Reuses existing hook paths and session state; avoids route/adapter churn. |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Focused helpers, mirrored assets, focused tests, and full test pass. |

## Failing Items

- None.

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh`
- Re-check: `bash scripts/contract-worktree.sh finish`

## Summary

- Pass. The implementation satisfies the approved plan and keeps the change advisory-only, session-local, and inside the existing hook runtime boundary.

## External Acceptance Advice
> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: Claude
> **External Source**: claude-review
> **External Started**: 2026-05-30T15:48:00+0800
> **External Completed**: 2026-05-30T15:54:00+0800

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories:
  - Mixed branch status in `origin/main...HEAD`: branch diff against `origin/main` includes the pre-existing local `main` commit `9d2f713` plus this sprint's uncommitted changes. Local `main..HEAD` is empty before this sprint commit, so `contract-worktree finish` will merge only the new sprint commit into local `main`.
  - `checks/latest.json` reported `external_acceptance.status: missing` before this section was recorded; this section closes that finish gate.
  - `is_nontrivial_code_task_intent()` depends on existing prompt classifiers; future classifier renames should recheck nudge behavior.
  - `post-bash.sh` now relies on existing `hook_json_escape`; focused hook tests verified the runtime path.
- Acceptance checklist: pass
