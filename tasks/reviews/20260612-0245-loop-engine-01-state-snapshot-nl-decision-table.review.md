## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: acceptance review for the first Loop Engine sprint backlog item.
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: P1 - implementation scope is the hook-only
  `state-snapshot` CLI, its fixture tests, and the NL decision-table reference
  doc. P2 - `src/cli/hook-entry.ts` dispatches `state-snapshot`; the command
  reads file-backed workflow state and emits one JSON line; tests cover none,
  draft, approved, executing, stale marker, foreign worktree, and bad flag
  cases. P3 - behavior stays read-only and does not alter prompt classifier
  authority, matching the staged-clean-path proof-point boundary.
- Root cause or plan evidence: the original research required a cheap proof
  input before any classifier deletion. `ff13087` implements that input without
  connecting it to prompt-guard.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: not invoked; this review records local verification for
  the landed commit.
- Commands run: `repo-harness-hook state-snapshot --json` -> 275 bytes in the
  main worktree snapshot; `bun test tests/cli/state-snapshot.test.ts` -> 7 pass;
  `bun test tests/cli/prompt-guard-decision.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts`
  -> 109 pass; `bun test` -> 639 pass; `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`
  -> OK; `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh` -> OK; `bun
  scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text` -> no drift signals;
  `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run` -> OK.
- Manual checks: NL decision table states it is an eval input, not runtime
  authority; prompt classifier and prompt-guard files remain unchanged by
  `ff13087`; row 1 is now closed in the sprint ledger.
- Supporting artifacts: `src/cli/hook/state-snapshot.ts`,
  `tests/cli/state-snapshot.test.ts`,
  `docs/reference-configs/loop-engine-nl-decision-table.md`, and
  `tasks/sprints/20260612-0236-loop-engine.sprint.md`.
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes, through
  `tasks/notes/20260612-0338-loop-engine-01-workflow-closeout.notes.md`.
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/` and `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`.

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: pass
> **External Reviewer**: Codex
> **External Source**: local verification
> **External Started**: 2026-06-12 03:38
> **External Completed**: 2026-06-12 03:41

- P1 blockers: none.
- P2 advisories: route A/B eval is still required before any classifier cutover.
- Acceptance checklist: snapshot command exists, output is <=1KB, fixtures cover
  required plan states, NL table exists, full test suite passed, and
  prompt-guard runtime behavior is unchanged.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Adds a read-only `repo-harness-hook state-snapshot --json` hot-path command.
- Adds a natural-language projection of the current prompt decision table for
  evaluation only.
- Does not edit `prompt-intents.ts`, `prompt-guard-decision.ts`, or
  `prompt-guard.sh`.

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- The research thesis remains unproven until `loop-engine-02-routing-ab-eval`
  compares TS routing against snapshot plus NL decision-table self-routing.
- Old untracked scaffold in
  `/Users/chris/Projects/agentic-dev-wt-loop-engine-01-state-snapshot-nl-decision-table`
  can be cleaned after this closeout is safely merged or applied.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Snapshot command and fixture coverage meet the slice acceptance criteria |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Provides the proof-point input while preserving staged cutover gates |
| Design quality | 9/10 | Read-only hot-path command avoids full CLI load and leaves prompt authority unchanged |
| Code quality | 9/10 | Focused tests plus hook-runtime regression show no classifier behavior drift |

## Failing Items

- (none)

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/cli/state-snapshot.test.ts`.
- Re-check: `repo-harness-hook state-snapshot --json | wc -c` stays <=1024.
- Before classifier cutover: run the `loop-engine-02-routing-ab-eval` A/B task.

## Summary

- loop-engine-01 is accepted as complete. The implementation landed in
  `ff13087`, fulfills the first sprint backlog row, and intentionally stops
  before A/B eval, shadow injection, or classifier deletion.
