## Mode Evidence

- Selected route: plan-eng-review (captured approved plan, contract worktree execution)
- P1/P2/P3 evidence: plan `## P1 架构图` / `## P2 已追踪关键路径` / `## P3 设计判断` — both dispatch chains traced to the repo-vendored resolution point (`hook-shim.sh` exec line, `runtime.ts:115`), 97app incident traced end to end, central-first + pin chosen over de-vendoring.
- Root cause or plan evidence: fleet drift root cause = hook implementation vendored per repo under user-level dispatch; fix = flip script resolution to central-first with explicit repo pin.

## Verification Evidence

- Waza `/check` run: equivalent evaluator pass executed in-session (full suite + required checks + contract verification); see scorecard below.
- Commands run: `bun test` (612 pass / 0 fail), `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`, `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`, `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`, `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`, `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`, `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh`
- Manual checks: shim resolution matrix exercised via tests (central preferred, pin honored, env override, bundle-missing fallback, no-vendored-hooks repo via central, real dispatcher cwd/HOOK_REPO_ROOT probe); install idempotence + stale-file cleanup asserted.
- Supporting artifacts: `tests/hook-shim-resolution.test.ts`, resolution describe block in `tests/cli/hook.test.ts`, doctor source cases in `tests/cli/doctor.test.ts`
- Implementation notes reviewed: yes (`tasks/notes/20260610-1822-central-hook-runtime.notes.md`)
- Run snapshot: `.ai/harness/runs/run-20260610T184418-62011-20260610-1822-central-hook-runtime.json`

## External Acceptance Advice

> **External Acceptance**: unavailable
> **External Reviewer**: gpt-5-codex
> **External Source**: codex-review

- P1 blockers: none
- P2 advisories: fix `~/.codex/config.toml` `service_tier` value ("default" is rejected by codex-cli 0.130.0, expects "fast" or "flex") so peer acceptance can run again
- Acceptance checklist: unavailable
- Manual Override: peer codex CLI cannot start on this machine (config.toml `service_tier = "default"` incompatible with codex-cli 0.130.0); user config not mutated by agent policy. Verification relied on 612-test suite, required checks, and machine-verified contract criteria.

## Behavior Diff Notes

- Hook scripts now resolve env override → policy pin → central copy → vendored fallback on both chains; previously always `<repo>/.ai/hooks`.
- `run-hook.sh` dispatches hooks relative to its own directory and hard-errors instead of guessing `$HOME` as repo root when invoked centrally without context.
- `repo-harness.sh install` additionally builds `~/.repo-harness/hooks` (clean rebuild + `.version` stamp); `status` and `doctor` report the active hook source.
- Self-host repo pins `"hook_source": "repo"`, so agentic-dev behavior is unchanged (live working-tree hooks).

## Residual Risks / Follow-ups

- Rollout must trust the existing fleet in the same pass as reinstalling the shim (installed Jun 4 shim predates the trust gate; new shim + empty trust file would silently disable hooks).
- Repos with intentionally patched vendored hooks would silently switch to central after install; escape hatch is the policy pin, surfaced by doctor/status.
- Deferred: stop vendoring `.ai/hooks` at init/migrate (tasks/todo.md).

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Functionality | 9/10 | Full resolution matrix covered by tests on both chains; install hygiene asserted |
| Product depth | 8/10 | Solves the fleet-drift root cause with explicit pin/override escape hatches and observability |
| Design quality | 8/10 | Mirrored resolution order across bash/TS; no new abstraction beyond one resolver per chain |
| Code quality | 8/10 | Dual-copy hooks kept in sync; tests realpath-safe; doc + contract surfaces updated |

## Failing Items

- none

## Retest Steps

- Re-run: `bun test tests/hook-shim-resolution.test.ts tests/hook-shim-trust.test.ts tests/cli/hook.test.ts tests/cli/doctor.test.ts`
- Re-check: `bash scripts/verify-sprint.sh`

## Summary

- Central-first hook runtime resolution landed on both dispatch chains with pin/env overrides, install bundle + version stamp, doctor/status source reporting, docs and root contract updates, and regression coverage; all required checks green.
