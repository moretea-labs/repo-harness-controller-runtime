# repo-harness 0.4.2 Release Prep Notes

## Scope

Prepare the npm release metadata and user-facing release docs for
`repo-harness@0.4.2`.

## Decisions

| Decision | Why | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Use `0.4.2` | `repo-harness@0.4.1` is the npm latest, and `0.4.2` is unpublished. The post-0.4.1 diff is a compatible package/template update around PRD/Sprint planning and helper runtime isolation. | Treat the new command facade as part of the still-compatible 0.4.x workflow line instead of cutting a minor release. |
| Keep one package/template version line | `0.4.0` retired the separate generated workflow compatibility line, and no new compatibility split was introduced by this slice. | Downstream generated stamps move together to `repo-harness@0.4.2+template@0.4.2`. |
| Mark publish steps pending | This slice updates release-required documents and metadata only; npm publish, registry readback, tag, and GitHub release still need explicit maintainer action. | The release filing is a prep artifact until the release gate and publish/readback are run. |
