## Design Decisions

- Recovered useful code deltas from the deleted linked worktree archives instead of treating `_ops/worktree-cleanup` tarballs as the deliverable.
- Kept `plan-artifact-semantic-stems` because it changes runtime artifact naming for transient host slugs and includes tests.
- Kept `codex-attachment-context-priority` because it fixes current-input file precedence in SessionStart and Codex handoff resume prompts.
- Dropped old `tasks/todo.md` timestamp changes and standalone plan/contract/review scaffolds from `codex`, `prompt-guard-cli-rewrite-plan`, and `repo-harness-autoplan-repo-harness-ship-pr`; those were not executable feature deltas.
