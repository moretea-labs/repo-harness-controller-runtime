# Implementation Notes: think-scan-init-hook

> **Plan**: `plans/plan-20260613-0314-think-scan-init-hook.md`
> **Status**: Draft capture only

## Decisions

- Keep the scan request as a Draft plan artifact only. There is no active-plan marker, contract projection, sprint review, or implementation slice attached to it yet.
- Do not infer execution authority from this file. A future slice should first fill the P1/P2/P3 routing and Evidence Contract fields, then run the normal plan -> contract -> worktree flow.

## Verification

- `test -f .ai/harness/active-plan && sed -n '1,80p' .ai/harness/active-plan || true` produced no active marker.
- `test -f tasks/contracts/20260613-0314-think-scan-init-hook.contract.md && sed -n '1,220p' tasks/contracts/20260613-0314-think-scan-init-hook.contract.md || true` produced no contract file.
- `test -f tasks/reviews/20260613-0314-think-scan-init-hook.review.md && sed -n '1,180p' tasks/reviews/20260613-0314-think-scan-init-hook.review.md || true` produced no review file.
