## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Research Before Planning
- Deeply read relevant code paths and persist findings to `docs/researches/`.
- Capture hidden contracts, edge cases, and integration risks before updating `docs/spec.md` or proposing execution.

### 2. Annotation Cycle
- Iterate plan updates directly in `plans/plan-*.md` via inline notes.
- Treat `.ai/harness/active-plan` as authoritative for this worktree when present; `.ai/harness/active-worktree` records the owning worktree; `.claude/.active-plan` is a legacy fallback during transition.
- Switch between concurrent plans with `bash .ai/harness/scripts/switch-plan.sh --plan <plan-file>`.
- Fill the plan/contract workflow inventory before implementation.
- Do not implement while plan status is `Draft` or `Annotating`.

### 3. Plan Node Default
- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks.
- If no stable product truth exists, run `bash .ai/harness/scripts/new-spec.sh`.
- When Codex Plan mode or Waza `/think` reaches a decision-complete plan, capture it with `bash .ai/harness/scripts/capture-plan.sh --slug <slug> --title <title>` and the plan text on stdin.
- If no captured active execution plan exists, run `bash .ai/harness/scripts/new-plan.sh --slug <slug> --title <title>` or capture a finished planning note with `bash .ai/harness/scripts/capture-plan.sh`.
- If the user asks for a Sprint backlog, run `bash .ai/harness/scripts/new-sprint.sh --slug <slug> --title <title>`; it writes `plans/sprints/*.sprint.md`, not `plans/plan-*.md`.
- When the user approves implementation, run `bash .ai/harness/scripts/plan-to-todo.sh --plan <active-plan>` or capture the approved plan with `--status Approved --execute`; this creates contract/review/notes scaffolding and leaves plan tasks in `## Task Breakdown`.
- Re-plan when execution drifts.

### 4. Research Delegation Strategy
- The main agent decides whether to spawn based on task breadth, context impact, raw-log volume, and callable runner availability.
- Keep one ownership boundary per spawned sidecar.
- Do not ask the user for spawn confirmation. If no sidecar runner is callable or spawning is not worth the context cost, perform the same bounded research trace in the main thread and persist conclusions to `docs/researches/`.
- Recovery profile: `{{RECOVERY_PROFILE}}`.
- State profile: `{{STATE_PROFILE}}`.

### 5. Self-Improvement Loop
- Append correction-derived rules to `tasks/lessons.md`.

### 6. Verification Before Done
- No task completion without test/build evidence.

### 6b. Contract Verification
- Define per-sprint contract files in `tasks/contracts/`.
- Verify contract exit criteria before claiming completion.
- Require Waza `/check` to produce the matching evaluator review before any done/completed response.
- Use `.ai/harness/scripts/verify-contract.sh --contract tasks/contracts/{plan-stem}.contract.md --strict`.

### 7. Balanced Elegance
- Redesign hacky non-trivial fixes before shipping.

### 8. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- Start fixing when logs/tests provide sufficient evidence.
