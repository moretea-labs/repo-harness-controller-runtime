# repo-harness-plan

Use this command when the user wants a decision-complete plan for repo-harness workflow work.

## Protocol

1. Confirm the working repo with `pwd` or `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
2. Run `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo <repo> --format text` when the target repo has this engine available.
3. Read repo-local `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tasks/todos.md`, and `.ai/harness/policy.json` when present.
4. Before recommending implementation, write a workflow inventory: active plan path, expected contract/review/notes files, `tasks/todos.md`, `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`, `.ai/harness/runs/`, allowed-path owner, and the plan switching or worktree isolation rule.
5. Produce one recommended plan and name the next action command: `repo-harness-init`, `repo-harness-scaffold`, `repo-harness-migrate`, `repo-harness-upgrade`, `repo-harness-repair`, or `repo-harness-check`.
6. When the plan is decision-complete, capture it with `.ai/harness/scripts/capture-plan.sh --slug <slug> --title <title>` so the repo has a file-backed `plans/plan-*.md` artifact.

## Failure Modes

- If the inspector cannot classify the repo, keep the plan in Draft and list the missing files.
- If implementation approval is absent, do not run `plan-to-todo.sh`.
- If the requested command surface is ambiguous, pick one public command and name why the alternatives are out of scope.

## Boundaries

- Does not edit implementation files or run `plan-to-todo.sh` by default.
- May save a plan artifact with `.ai/harness/scripts/capture-plan.sh`; do not generate contracts, reviews, todos, or worktrees until the user approves implementation.
- Do not optimize for a planning harness by removing approval, review, or contract scope gates. If an automated run stalls on approval, fix the test harness or capture route, not the approval boundary.
- Do not expose `hooks-init`, `docs-init`, or `create-project-dirs` as public commands; they are internal implementation steps.
