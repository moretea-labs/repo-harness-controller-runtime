# repo-harness-deploy

Use this command when the user wants a focused deployment and operations
configuration check for the repo-local harness.

## Protocol

1. Confirm the target repo path and keep the pass read-only by default.
2. Read `.ai/harness/policy.json` and inspect the `operations` contract.
3. Check the tracked deployment surface:
   - `deploy/`
   - `deploy/sql/`
   - `deploy/env/.env.example`
   - release, submission, or runbook files when present
4. Check the private operations boundary:
   - `_ops/` is ignored
   - real env files, secrets, provider state, artifacts, logs, and scratch files stay under `_ops/`
5. Run:
   - `bash .ai/harness/scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`
6. Report readiness gaps as concrete missing or misplaced files, not as an app deployment attempt.

## Failure Modes

- If `_ops/` contains required private state, report the path class without printing values.
- If deploy SQL order fails, stop at `check-deploy-sql-order.sh`.
- If the user asks to publish or deploy, route to the project release/deploy process instead of this read-only check.

## Boundaries

- Read-only by default.
- Does not publish or deploy.
- Does not migrate `_ops/` assets into `deploy/` unless the user explicitly asks for a repair/migration.
- Does not inspect or print secrets, tokens, or real environment values.
- Does not replace `repo-harness-check`; it only covers deploy and operations readiness.
