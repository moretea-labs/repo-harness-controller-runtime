# Product Spec

> **Status**: Approved
> **Owner**: repo-harness maintainers

## Product Outcome

`repo-harness` makes long-running AI engineering work reviewable and resumable
inside the repository. A maintainer should be able to hand Claude, Codex, or a
future agent an approved plan or sprint, let it work in an isolated branch or
worktree, and review completion from files: plan, contract, notes, checks,
trace, review, and handoff.

## Primary Users

- Maintainers adopting an existing repository that already has product code.
- Engineers running Claude/Codex sessions across multiple days, hosts, or
  worktrees.
- Reviewers who need a concise human review card plus machine evidence before
  accepting agent-authored changes.

## Non-Goals

- `repo-harness` is not a hosted agent platform, product runtime, or database service. Its local MCP controller is a bounded control surface over repository-backed state, not an unrestricted remote shell.
- It does not replace the target repository's build, test, deploy, or release
  authority.
- It does not treat chat history, SQLite state, or hosted agent threads as the
  durable source of truth.

## Core Invariants

- Durable truth lives in repo files: `plans/`, `tasks/issues/`, `tasks/contracts/`,
  `tasks/reviews/`, `tasks/notes/`, `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`,
  `.ai/harness/runs/*.json`, and `.ai/harness/handoff/`.
- `tasks/current.md` is a generated orientation snapshot, not a kanban board,
  live lock, or implementation gate.
- Agents may only widen scope by editing the active contract and leaving
  reviewable evidence.
- Contract verification, review recommendation, external acceptance or manual
  override, and latest trace evidence are required before closeout.
- Worktree isolation protects unrelated dirty state; agents must not absorb
  unrelated changes from the target tree.

## Workflow Surfaces

| Surface | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/spec.md` | Maintainers | Stable product intent and safety boundary |
| `plans/prds/`, `plans/sprints/`, `plans/plan-*.md` | Controller / Planner | Decision-complete work packages |
| `tasks/issues/*.issue.json`, `tasks/issues/*.issue.md` | Controller | Durable Issue intent, dependency-aware Tasks, and lifecycle state |
| `tasks/contracts/*.contract.md` | Implementer | Allowed paths, delegation, and exit criteria |
| `tasks/reviews/*.review.md` | Evaluator | Human Review Card, evidence, risk, acceptance |
| `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` | Verifier | Current structured gate result |
| `.ai/harness/runs/*.json` | Verifier | Immutable workflow run/trace snapshots |
| `.ai/harness/jobs/` | Controller | Local agent Task Run metadata, prompts, logs, and result evidence |
| `.ai/harness/local-jobs/` | Local Controller | Approval-aware local Job Tickets that bridge ChatGPT, the visual UI, and agent Runs |
| `.ai/harness/edit-sessions/` | Controller | Bounded direct-edit metadata, hashes, backups, and rollback evidence |
| `.ai/harness/handoff/` | Session owner | Resume packets and exact next step |

## Safety Boundaries

- Hook logic is a guardrail and context accelerator; it must not silently make
  product decisions, merge work, publish releases, or bypass review.
- External knowledge and memory are advisory. Current repo files and live check
  output override summaries.
- Delegated work remains parent-owned: explorer and verifier are read-only;
  worker edits are constrained to contract `allowed_paths`.

## Human Review Expectations

Human reviewers should start with the task review's `## Human Review Card`,
then inspect the active contract, changed files, latest trace, and failed or
skipped checks. A pass means the reviewer can see what changed, why it is in
scope, what verified it, what risk remains, and how to roll it back.

## Acceptance Scenarios

- An existing repo can adopt the harness, generate workflow files, and pass
  `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`.
- A sprint row can expand into a plan, contract, notes, review, latest trace,
  and handoff without relying on previous chat.
- A fresh agent session can read source artifacts first and resume from the
  exact next step.
- A maintainer can reject or accept an agent change from the Human Review Card
  plus machine evidence.
