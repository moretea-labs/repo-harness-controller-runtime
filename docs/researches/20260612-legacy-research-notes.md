> **Migration Notice (2026-06-12)**: 架构决策已定——研究报告权威面迁往 `docs/researches/*`;本文件将在 `arch-doc-loop-04-research-surface-migration`(`tasks/sprints/20260612-0256-architecture-doc-loop.sprint.md`)执行时退役为 tombstone 指针。在 slice 4 落地前,本文件保持现有契约(ResearchGate 等仍引用它),新研究报告写 `docs/researches/`、此处只留条目指针。

## 2026-06-12 docs/architecture 真相来源闭环(queue engine + freshness gate)

- Full report: `docs/researches/20260612-architecture-doc-truth-loop.md`(plan 记录: `plans/archive/plan-20260612-0255-architecture-doc-truth-loop.md`;执行权威 sprint: `tasks/sprints/20260612-0256-architecture-doc-loop.sprint.md`)。
- Conclusion(方向已批准):架构文档体系只有写入端没有消费端——27 个 pending request 自 2026-05-28/29 堆积,`docs/architecture/index.md` 受控段已损坏(条目落入 `## Review Backlog`、同秒重复行)。修复方向是 per-capability dirty card(`requests/<capability_id>.md`)+ index Pending 段全派生(BEGIN/END 标记内 reindex 重写)+ 切片关账门禁(`freshness_gate` advisory→strict)。
- 根因(已验证):`architecture-drift.sh:456` 无锚点 append-to-EOF;`prune_superseded_pending_lines` 于 2026-06-10(`a4ad852`)引入、晚于 backlog 且只删行不归档;并发 PostToolUse 在 grep-dedup 与 append 之间竞态。处置:删除 append+prune 状态机,换"扫目录、重写受控块"派生模型。
- 隐藏契约:`post-edit-guard.sh:47` grep `[ArchitectureDrift] Request:` 前缀触发 contract-sync 链(新 queue CLI 必须保留该前缀);`archive-architecture-request.sh` 只解析 `> **Status**:` 首行(卡片格式零改动兼容);`pi_install_helpers` 只装平铺文件(禁止 scripts/lib 共享库);hooks 字节 parity 测试强制 `.ai/hooks` 与 `assets/hooks` 镜像同 slice 落地。
- Codex 外部评审(两轮)收紧执行:strict/check 缺 queue/resolver 必须 fail-closed(advisory/off 才 fail-open);shell 只编排、merge/JSON/渲染进 architecture-event.ts;`triage --before <cutoff>` 护栏防止盲并新近 pending;本工作先于 loop-engine-01;`architecture-drift.sh` 被 `architecture-queue.sh record` 吸收删除;PostToolUse 永不硬拦。

## 2026-06-12 Loop-in-Hook vs NLAH/Loop-Engineering 架构对比

- Full report: `docs/researches/20260612-loop-in-hook-vs-nlah-loop-engineering.md` (sources: arXiv 2603.25723 full text, Addy Osmani *Loop Engineering* 2026-06-08, `_ref/teach-fireworks` note).
- Conclusion (hypothesis, medium confidence): the file-backed spine and acceptance-tightening gates are exactly the modules the NLAH paper validates (+4.8/+5.5); the weak axes are the TS prompt-intent classifier (code interpreting natural language — the inverse of the paper's validated division of labor), the absence of a delegation surface (contracts are ~80% of an agent-call κ but only gate humans), and the missing scheduled heartbeat.
- Guardrails from the same evidence: verifier rubric drift (−8.4 OSWorld) and multi-candidate search are dominated; Full IHR costs ~13.6× prompt tokens for solved-set replacement, so any delegation layer needs explicit budget caps.
- First proof point before any implementation: routing A/B eval (TS verdict vs ~1KB state-snapshot + NL decision table) on the existing `benchmark:skills` scaffolding. No code changes shipped with this entry.

## 2026-06-06 CodeGraph 0.9.9 Refresh

### Boundary
- `@colbymchenry/codegraph` remains a repo-local dev dependency for this self-host repo, resolved local-first through `node_modules/.bin/codegraph`.
- The PATH-visible global shim at `~/.local/bin/codegraph` stays on the same version so MCP fallback and direct shell use do not drift from the repo-local CLI.
- MCP and hook adapter config were not rewritten; this was a package/index refresh only.

### Trace
- npm live latest reported `@colbymchenry/codegraph@0.9.9`; the repo previously declared `^0.9.6`.
- `bun update @colbymchenry/codegraph` updated `package.json` and `bun.lock` to `^0.9.9`.
- `npm install -g @colbymchenry/codegraph@latest` plus the existing `~/.local/bin/codegraph` shim made local, global, and PATH-visible `codegraph --version` all report `0.9.9`.
- `bash scripts/ensure-codegraph.sh --sync` refreshed `.codegraph/` with the new CLI and reported `sync-index: changed`.

### Verification
- `bash scripts/ensure-codegraph.sh --check --json` reported CodeGraph `present`, version `0.9.9`, no local/global drift, and project index `up-to-date`.
- `repo-harness doctor --json` reported `10 ok / 0 warn / 0 fail`, including CodeGraph readiness with Codex and Claude MCP configured.
- `bun test tests/cli/codegraph.test.ts tests/cli/codegraph-resolver.test.ts tests/tooling/codegraph-integration.test.ts tests/check-agent-tooling.test.ts tests/cli/doctor.test.ts` passed with `21 pass / 0 fail`.

## Architecture Observations
### Patterns & Conventions
- The root skill is now a compatibility router. The operational contract moved into scripts plus the workflow manifest, policy file, and context map.
- The repo-local workflow contract now exists as a machine-readable manifest installed at `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`.
- `.ai/context/context-map.json` and `.ai/harness/policy.json` layer progressive-loading and enforcement metadata on top of the workflow manifest.
- Codex context pressure now follows a filesystem-first contract: rollout JSONL token counts drive waterline decisions; SQLite is a rebuildable sidecar read model, not task state.
- Session recovery is explicit handoff + fresh-session bootstrap. Auto-compact is treated as an unreliable fallback, not a primary continuation path.
- `.ai/hooks/` remains the shared source of truth; `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` are host adapter surfaces, and repo-local `.claude/hooks/` should not be generated by default.

### Implicit Contracts
- `scripts/check-task-sync.sh` requires `tasks/` changes whenever substantive repo files change.
- `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` reads `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` for the baseline required-path inventory and layers `policy.json` on top for progressive-context surfaces.
- `scripts/migrate-project-template.sh` now runs inspect -> legacy-doc migration -> workflow refresh -> verification.
- Legacy `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/plan.md`, and execution-log style `docs/PROGRESS.md` must be migrated before template refresh.
- `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` expects the generated templates/helpers/directories to exist even when no active plan is present.
- `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict` now also expects `docs/spec.md`, `tasks/reviews/`, `scripts/new-spec.sh`, `scripts/new-sprint.sh`, and `scripts/verify-sprint.sh` to exist in the self-host repo.
- Generated repos should install shared hooks only under `.ai/hooks/`; preserving explicit user-authored `.claude/hooks/custom-*.sh` commands during migration is acceptable, but generating adapter-side shim hooks by default is not.
- `.ai/context/context-map.json` and `.ai/harness/policy.json` are now part of the generated contract, not optional documentation extras.
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` is now a legacy migration input; durable progress belongs under `tasks/workstreams/` and release history belongs in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- The README now owns the "first 5 minutes" contract, so onboarding regressions should be treated like product regressions, not copy drift.

### Edge Cases & Intricacies
- Self-migration can fail if installer logic tries to `cp` a file onto itself; the shared lib now skips identical source/destination copies.
- Shell consumers need a JSON runtime bridge; `project-init-lib.sh` resolves `node`, `bun`, or `python3` before reading the workflow contract.
- Self-host parity matters twice: the installed runtime contract must match the asset contract, and `.ai/hooks/` must match `assets/hooks/`.
- Legacy doc migration must be idempotent, so imported sections use stable markers and archived backups use deterministic names.
- Re-running migration against an existing managed `.gitignore` block must replace the block without using multiline `awk -v` substitution.
- `hook_structured_error()` output does not automatically flow into `.claude/.trace.jsonl`, so failure analysis needs a dedicated JSONL sink rather than assuming trace hooks will capture guard failures.
- `hook_structured_error()` still accepts legacy arg-4 action shims (`block`/`warn`/`advisory`), so any cleanup there needs to preserve backward compatibility for generated hooks.
- `assemble-template.ts` and `initializer-question-pack.ts` originally hard-coded the `v2` question-pack path; moving to `v3` requires explicit backward-compatible reads for tests and legacy callers.
- `workflow_append_event()` sits on the critical path for both `trace-event.sh` and `prepare-handoff.sh`; treating supplemental event metadata as hard-fail JSON can break both flows at once.
- Generated helper installation lists are duplicated across `project-init-lib.sh`, `create-project-dirs.sh`, and `migrate-project-template.sh`, so new helper scripts must be wired in at multiple layers.
- `summarize-failures.sh` is Bun-first for repo consistency, but it now needs an explicit Node fallback because generated repos may not have Bun on PATH.
- Hook failures write to `.ai/harness/failures/latest.jsonl`, while `.claude/.trace.jsonl` captures surrounding tool activity. They complement each other; neither replaces the other.
- The progressive-loading contract should not infer functional boundaries from physical layout globs like `apps/*`, `packages/*`, or `services/*`; those directories can be too broad in large repos.
- Functional-block context files are selected by `scripts/select-agent-context-blocks.sh`, preferred `REPO_HARNESS_CONTEXT_BLOCKS`, legacy `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CONTEXT_BLOCKS`, `.ai/context/agent-context-blocks.txt`, or pre-existing nested `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` files.
- Once helper installation moves behind `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`, regression tests should assert helper presence via the manifest instead of string-matching explicit shell argument lists.
- `SessionStart` context injection should only emit a real generated resume packet containing `## Resume Prompt`; a bootstrap placeholder must stay silent to avoid context pollution.
- `workflow_write_handoff()` runs under `set -euo pipefail` via `prepare-handoff.sh`, so optional grep-based event extraction must tolerate no-match pipelines.

- Policy-sourced harness output paths must stay repo-relative; absolute paths or `..` segments should fall back to the default workflow surface before any hook writes files.
- Handoff changed-file summaries must include untracked files and must not silently hide the files most likely to be missing after an interrupted long task.
- `.claude/skill-factory` is a feature sidecar, not a reliable signal that the repo should route into Skill Factory mode; initialized repos also contain it.
- Partially migrated repos may already have a legacy `tasks/todo.md`; migration must normalize that file instead of only handling missing files and `docs/TODO.md`.

## 2026-05-31 Laper Stack Scaffold Borrow Boundary

### Source Stack
- Laper-Agent: Python 3.13, Google ADK + FastAPI.
- Laper-App: TypeScript, React 19 + Vite + Plate + Loro CRDT.
- Laper-backend: Go, Gin + Supabase REST, goroutine pool.
- Laper-Chat: TypeScript/Bun, Mastra + Hono + AI SDK.
- Laper-CMS-admin: JavaScript, React 19 + Vite + shadcn/ui.

### External Signals
- Google ADK is now documented as a production agent framework across Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, and Kotlin, with Python install path `google-adk` and FastAPI streaming examples (`https://adk.dev/`, `https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/streaming/quickstart-streaming/`).
- Mastra positions itself as a TypeScript framework for agents, memory, tools, workflows, evals, and tracing, and documents integration with Hono plus deployment on Bun-compatible runtimes (`https://mastra.ai/ai-agent-framework`).
- Plate is a React rich-text editor framework with shadcn-style owned components and MCP/AI-ready surface area (`https://platejs.org/docs`).
- Loro is a JavaScript/TypeScript CRDT library for local-first collaboration, with explicit peer identity and document sync constraints (`https://www.loro.dev/docs/api/js`).
- Supabase REST remains useful as a PostgREST CRUD layer, but still reflects database schema authority; it should not hide domain ownership in scaffold guidance (`https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api`).

### Decision
- Borrow Plate + Loro as a first-class `collaborative-editor` AI-native scaffold profile for document/CMS/knowledge-workspace products.
- Borrow Mastra as an optional TypeScript agent runtime inside `chat-agent` and `workflow-agent` profiles when the product needs memory, tools, workflows, evals, or tracing.
- Keep ADK/FastAPI and Go/Gin behind `sidecar-kernel`; they are good capability kernels, not global app-facing defaults.
- Do not change the A-K plan catalog or default `AI_NATIVE_PROFILE=none`. The Laper stack is product-profile evidence, not a new plan code.

## 2026-05-31 Approved Plan Projection Prompt Boundary

### Symptom
- A user approved `plans/plan-20260531-0032-ai-native-scaffold-architecture-profile.md`, then sent `implement this plan`.
- `UserPromptSubmit -> .ai/hooks/run-hook.sh -> .ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` classified the prompt as implementation intent but not approval/projection intent, so the Approved plan reached `ContractGuard` and hard-blocked on the missing sprint contract.

### Fix Boundary
- Exact active-plan execution prompts such as `implement this plan`, `implement the plan`, and `执行这个方案` now route to the existing non-blocking `PlanExecutionGate` when the active plan is already `Approved` and the contract scaffold is missing.
- Draft or Annotating plans still hard-block under `PlanStatusGuard`; broad bug-fix prompts without a plan contract still hard-block under `ContractGuard`.
- `.ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` and `assets/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` remain byte-equivalent for generated repo parity.
- `plan-to-todo.sh` must create `.ai/harness/planning/` in linked contract worktrees before clearing pending orchestration; otherwise strict workflow verification fails on a directory that existed only as untracked local state in the primary worktree.
- After projection, main worktree follow-up prompts that paste the linked worktree path or `codex/<slug>` branch should route to non-blocking `WorktreeExecutionGate`; the primary active marker is intentionally empty, so `PlanStatusGuard` would be the wrong remediation.
- `下一刀` summaries are planning/report context, even when they contain implementation, finish, commit, or merge vocabulary. They should stay out of `PlanStatusGuard` and BDD injection unless a separate line is an explicit execution command such as `执行这个方案`.

## 2026-05-31 Prompt Guard TS Decision Engine Notes

### Decision
- Keep `UserPromptSubmit -> repo-harness-hook --route default -> .ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` as the public host adapter contract.
- Keep shell responsible for hook JSON parsing, regex intent facts, workflow file reads, side effects such as `maybe_capture_embedded_approved_plan`, and host-safe rendering.
- Move the fragile `intent x plan/workflow state -> action` decision into a pure TypeScript table in `src/cli/hook/prompt-guard-decision.ts`.
- Expose the table through the lightweight hook entry command `repo-harness-hook prompt-guard-decide`; `repo-harness prompt-guard-decide` remains an internal fallback.

### Why
- The missed Draft-plan projection bug came from manually reusing two shell integer flags across separate branches.
- TypeScript `Record<PlanState, Record<ExecutionIntent, DecisionFn>>` makes plan-state/action coverage explicit and testable, while avoiding a full shell-to-TS rewrite of file I/O and renderer behavior.
- Shell renderers preserve the existing Claude/Codex hook output contract: blocks still exit 2 with human-readable stderr via `hook_structured_error`, and Codex non-`SessionStart` success stdout remains quiet through the dispatcher.

### Verification
- `tests/cli/prompt-guard-decision.test.ts` covers table coverage, Draft + `implement this plan`, no-active-plan projection, approved-plan scaffold advice, passive intents, done quality-gate actions, and both full CLI and lightweight hook-entry command paths.
- `tests/cli/hook.test.ts` covers the public `UserPromptSubmit --route default` chain through real `prompt-guard.sh` assets and the lightweight TS decision command.
- `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` remains the end-to-end behavior surface for generated hook copies, including `active Draft plan + implement this plan`, `active Draft plan + 执行这个方案`, pending plan capture, passive reports, and done gates.

## Technical Debt / Risks
- `ensure-task-workflow.sh` still assumes the workflow surface already exists; it does not yet synthesize a fallback runtime contract manifest for partially migrated repos.
- The workflow contract is machine-readable, but some shell stubs still create content bodies directly rather than deriving full file contents from the manifest.
- Root routing docs are repo-specific and can drift from future template conventions if not kept in sync.
- This repo still relies on migration/bootstrap scripts staying idempotent across repeated local runs.
- `.ai/hooks/` and `assets/hooks/` are now covered by parity tests, but the manual mirror still needs review whenever hook source changes.
- `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` depends on `node`, `bun`, or `python3` to parse the JSON manifest; the current fix makes that dependency explicit, but a pure-shell manifest reader would reduce bootstrap friction.
- If self-host bootstrap leaves required workflow directories or placeholder files unmaterialized, strict workflow verification degrades into baseline repo-repair noise and hides the real regression under test.

## Research Conclusions
### What to Preserve
- Repo-local tasks-first workflow surfaces as the main contract for Claude and Codex.
- Existing assets, evals, and test coverage as the canonical contract surface for this skill.
- Additive migration behavior that preserves user content and archives uncertain legacy docs.
- Self-host migration as a first-class verification target.
- The shared hook model where `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` invoke `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`; Codex also requires the user to trust the repo hook in Codex Settings before it executes.
- Clean repo-local defaults: generate `.ai/hooks/` as implementation, reserve `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` for adapter config, and keep user-owned overrides out of the generated implementation tree.
- The current multi-file control surface (`plans/`, `tasks/`, `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/reviews/`, `.ai/harness/*`) instead of collapsing into a single charter artifact.
- The split between stable root context and explicitly selected functional-block context, because it keeps root prompt mass predictable while still letting real ownership blocks speak for themselves.

### What to Change
- Keep helper installation, workflow verification, and migration rules anchored to `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json` and `.ai/harness/policy.json`.
- Keep self-hosting support first-class in migration tests.
- Maintain concise root routing docs so the repo demonstrates the intended downstream workflow.
- Treat `run_id`, `failure_class`, and 5-dimensional harness profiles as additive metadata with explicit consumers, not as new abstract control layers.
- Keep hook authority and failure handling explicit in docs so new maintainers do not have to infer the runtime chain from tests.
- Make parity risk explicit: generated output is the downstream contract, and self-hosted behavior must call out whether it matches or diverges.
- Keep the machine-readable policy focused on workflow enforcement; do not turn v1 into a heavyweight architecture linter.
- Keep `context_budget`, `handoff_resume`, and `sidecar_research` policy sections as runtime coordination metadata. The canonical goal/todo/research state remains Markdown/JSON files in the repo.

### Open Questions
- Whether `ensure-task-workflow.sh` should auto-install a fallback runtime contract manifest when run in a partially migrated repo.
- Whether future template assembly should expose a first-class “skill/tooling repo” preset instead of relying on hand-authored root routing docs.
- Whether future work should unify `.ai/hooks/` and `assets/hooks/` through generation or parity tests instead of manual sync.

## 2026-05-29 Codex Hook Output Protocol Notes

### Finding
- Codex accepts the `SessionStart` resume path when stdout is a `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` JSON object.
- Codex rejects ordinary human-readable stdout from `UserPromptSubmit` and `PostToolUse` hooks with `invalid ... JSON output`.
- The noisy new-session context came from a stale generated resume packet older than `.ai/harness/handoff/current.md`, combined with red context budget state and a pending capability-context queue.

### Decision
- Mark Codex adapter routes with `HOOK_HOST=codex`.
- Keep `SessionStart` stdout JSON behavior unchanged.
- In `run-hook.sh`, suppress successful stdout for Codex non-`SessionStart` hooks and mirror stdout to stderr only on failing hooks, so advisory text cannot poison Codex's JSON parser.
- Skip generated resume packets older than the current handoff; capability-context queue reminders may still inject on their own.

### Verification Surface
- Reproduce `prompt-guard.sh` and `post-bash.sh` through `run-hook.sh` with `HOOK_HOST=codex`; stdout must be empty on success.
- Reproduce `session-start-context.sh` with a newer handoff than resume; stale resume text must not be injected.
- Keep `.ai/hooks/` and `assets/hooks/` in parity.

## 2026-05-27 Prompt Intent Context Strip Notes

### What Changed
- `prompt-guard.sh` now separates the raw hook prompt from the user-intent text used by intent greps.
- The intent text strips injected XML-style context blocks such as `<skill>...</skill>` before plan, Waza route, implementation, and done-intent checks run.
- Explicit Waza `/think` / `$think` at the start of the user prompt still starts a Draft plan workflow; explanatory mentions of `$think` in the middle of a non-planning prompt do not.
- Explicit planning prompts now call `scripts/ensure-task-workflow.sh --new-plan`, so an older Draft/latest plan cannot globally occupy future Waza think planning.
- `PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:` prompts are treated as an embedded approved plan body: `prompt-guard.sh` captures them with `scripts/capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute` before implementation continues.
- Pure plan-shaped Markdown prompts also count as approved-plan bodies when the first nonblank line is an H1 and the body contains `## Summary` plus decision/execution sections such as `## Key Changes`, `## Tests`, `## Assumptions`, or P1/P2/P3 evidence.
- Trigger-question examples such as “会触发吗” / “does this trigger” are explicitly excluded even if the quoted example contains implementation wording.

### Why
- Expanded skill bodies can contain words such as `fix`, `bug`, `error`, `implement`, and `approved`. Running intent greps over that entire payload can bypass the `$think` plan-start bridge or misclassify a planning prompt as implementation.
- `get_active_plan` intentionally falls back to the latest non-archived plan for compatibility, but that fallback is not enough to decide that a new explicit planning task belongs to the old Draft. Worktree-first execution needs independent plan artifacts.
- Astrozi-style broad keyword matching is useful for TDD/BDD hints but too noisy for reliable plan capture; plan-shaped Markdown capture narrows the acceptance surface without requiring a magic prefix.
- The hook boundary stays conservative: it may create a Draft `plans/` artifact for explicit planning intent, and Approved projection still goes through `capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute` / `plan-to-todo.sh` rather than editing implementation files directly.

### Verification
- `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` covers expanded `<skill>` context, explanatory `$think` mentions, old-Draft plan-start independence, embedded approved-plan capture, pure plan-shaped Markdown capture, and trigger-question examples.
- `bun test tests/helper-scripts.test.ts` covers `ensure-task-workflow.sh --new-plan`.

## 2026-05-27 Hook Root Dispatch Notes

### Finding
- `.codex/hooks.json` correctly dispatches `UserPromptSubmit` to `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh prompt-guard.sh`, and the installed Codex skill copies match the source `assets/hooks/prompt-guard.sh`.
- The runtime boundary was still cwd-sensitive: `run-hook.sh` exported `HOOK_REPO_ROOT` but did not `cd` into it before executing the selected hook.
- `prompt-guard.sh` calls repo helpers by relative path, for example `scripts/capture-plan.sh`; if the host invokes the hook from a different cwd, plan capture can run against the wrong repo state.
- A plain new-feature request such as “我要开发新功能：做一个设置页” only reaches the BDD advisory branch. It is not a structured approved-plan body, so it does not call `capture-plan.sh` by itself.

### Decision
- Keep structured approved-plan capture conservative: `PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN:` and plan-shaped Markdown can project through `capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute`.
- Fix the hard runtime bug at the dispatcher boundary by making `run-hook.sh` enter `HOOK_REPO_ROOT` before running hook scripts.
- Treat natural “开发新功能” prompts as a separate product-policy decision: they can start a Draft plan in a future slice, but they should not be silently promoted to Approved execution without a concrete plan body.

### Verification
- `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` now covers `run-hook.sh` executing from `HOOK_REPO_ROOT` even when the caller cwd differs.
- Manual hook repro showed structured plan capture works after dispatcher root correction; plain feature prose remains advisory-only by design.

## 2026-05-28 Plain Feature Prompt Plan-Start Notes

### What Changed
- Plain new-feature prompts now route to `PlanStartGate` and create an independent Draft `plans/plan-*.md` artifact.
- This applies to feature-building language such as “我要开发新功能：做一个设置页” while preserving bug-hunt and direct execution guards.
- Plain feature plan-start stops at Draft. It may ensure the idle `tasks/todo.md` workflow surface exists, but it does not set a source plan, switch status to Executing, call `capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute`, or start contract worktrees.
- Chinese-only feature prompts can normalize to an empty ASCII slug, so the fallback slug is `feature-plan-HHMMSS` instead of the older `think-plan-HHMMSS`.

### Why
- The previous structured capture fix handled approved plan bodies, but ordinary “start developing a new feature” prompts still only emitted BDD guidance and did not create a file-backed plan.
- Draft plan creation is the smallest safe automation boundary: it records intent in `plans/` without treating a vague feature request as approval to execute.

### Verification
- `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` covers plain new-feature prompt -> Draft plan with idle `tasks/todo.md`, not execution projection.
- Existing bug-hunt, missing-plan implementation, embedded approved-plan, and plan-shaped Markdown tests keep the neighboring boundaries guarded.

## 2026-05-28 Plans/Contracts Autoresearch Inventory Notes

### What Changed
- Added `## Workflow Inventory` to source and runtime plan templates, captured-plan output, contract templates, and fallback heredocs in `new-plan.sh`, `capture-plan.sh`, `plan-to-todo.sh`, `ensure-task-workflow.sh`, and `project-init-lib.sh`.
- The inventory names active plan, sprint contract, review, implementation notes, `tasks/todo.md`, checks, run snapshots, `allowed_paths` scope authority, `switch-plan.sh`, and contract worktree execution.
- Replaced latest-plan-first wording with explicit active-marker semantics; after the 2026-05-28 migration, `.ai/harness/active-plan` is authoritative, `.claude/.active-plan` is a legacy fallback, and latest non-archived `plans/plan-*.md` remains a compatibility fallback.
- Updated `agentic-dev-plan`, root `SKILL.md`, reference configs, and assembly partials so planning instructions match generated artifacts.
- Recorded the experiment in `autoresearch/autoresearch-agentic-dev-20260528-120347/`: baseline 14/20, kept candidate 20/20.

### Why
- The Browserbase Autobrowse article's reusable lesson is not "remove gates for automation"; it is "make the reusable skill artifact carry the shortest reliable path and the state the next agent should not rediscover."
- The analogous pressure point in this repo is that plans and contracts had strong gates but did not put the state inventory directly before implementation.
- The smallest coherent change is to add inventory to plan/contract surfaces and keep approval/review/worktree boundaries intact.

### Verification
- `bun test tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/scaffold-parity.test.ts tests/output-parity.test.ts tests/agents-assembly.test.ts`
- First targeted run exposed an AGENTS line-budget regression at 263/260 lines; partial wording was compressed and the second targeted run passed 68 tests.

## 2026-05-28 CodeGraph Readiness Slice Notes

### What Changed
- `agentic-dev` now declares `@colbymchenry/codegraph` as a self-host `devDependency`; `bun install` materializes `node_modules/.bin/codegraph`.
- `scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh` resolves CodeGraph local-first, then global fallback, and reports `source`, local/global bin paths, version drift, and fallback use.
- `scripts/ensure-codegraph.sh --check --json` is a read-only wrapper around the existing tooling detector. Mutating `--init` and `--sync` paths remain explicit and do not write MCP config.
- Generated downstream policy remains global-MCP-first with `vendoring_policy: do-not-add-package-dependency`; the self-host exception lives in `.ai/harness/policy.json` and docs.

### Why
- The implementation preserves the split between host adapter installation and tool readiness. `install --target` stays host-only; CodeGraph readiness is a tool lifecycle concern.
- The existing tooling detector already carried MCP/index/readiness semantics, so the first slice changed that detector instead of creating a second readiness truth.

### Verification
- `bun test tests/check-agent-tooling.test.ts tests/cli/codegraph-resolver.test.ts`
- `bash scripts/ensure-codegraph.sh --check --json`
- `bash scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh --host codex --strict-readiness --json`
- `bunfig.toml` now sets `[test].root = "tests"` because Bun 1.3.10 still discovered `_ref/codegraph/__tests__` despite `pathIgnorePatterns`; repo-owned verification must not be poisoned by ignored reference checkouts.

## 2026-05-28 Active Plan Marker Migration Notes

### What Changed
- `.ai/harness/active-plan` is now the host-neutral active-plan marker named by `.ai/harness/policy.json`.
- `.claude/.active-plan` remains a transition fallback and mirror target so existing Claude-first projects keep working.
- Runtime hook state, helper scripts, generated helper templates, handoff resume, archive, switch-plan, workflow checks, and capture-plan now read the new marker first and fall back to the legacy marker before latest-plan compatibility fallback.
- Plan capture and plan switch write both markers; archive clears both markers when they point at the archived plan.
- Migration copies a legacy marker into `.ai/harness/active-plan` when the new marker is absent, and syncs legacy back from the new marker when the new marker already exists.

### Why
- `.claude/.active-plan` was a published compatibility surface, but its name encoded a single host in a workflow contract shared by Claude and Codex.
- Moving to `.ai/harness/active-plan` preserves the existing file-backed plan model while making the active selector part of the shared harness state.
- The key invariant remains: `plans/plan-*.md` contains plan content; the marker only selects the active plan. Latest non-archived plan remains a compatibility fallback, not the preferred ownership signal.

### Verification Surface
- `tests/helper-scripts.test.ts` covers host-neutral marker preference, dual-write capture, legacy-marker handoff compatibility, and concurrent switch mirroring.
- `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` covers Codex-only active marker execution and embedded approved-plan capture dual-write.
- `tests/migration-script.test.ts` covers legacy marker migration and runtime ignore block coverage.

## 2026-05-28 Hook Workflow Autoresearch Notes

### What Changed
- Ran `autoresearch` against the root `agentic-dev` skill with session artifacts under `autoresearch/autoresearch-agentic-dev-hooks-20260528-131222/`.
- Baseline hook workflow score was 12/25: the skill preserved the repo-file contract boundary but did not explicitly name Codex Settings trust, safe autoresearch trigger behavior, or hook-specific evidence surfaces.
- Kept one candidate mutation: added `## Hook Workflow Protocol` to `SKILL.md`.
- Added regression eval `repair-codex-hook-workflow` to `evals/evals.json`.
- Implemented `autoresearch-advisory.sh` as a self-host maintainer hook under `.ai/hooks/`, wired only into this repo's local adapters, and kept it advisory-only.
- Removed `autoresearch-advisory.sh` from `assets/hooks/` and default adapter templates so generated user projects do not install the development-only autoresearch hook.
- Collected local autoresearch run products under ignored `autoresearch/`; the advisory hook scans both legacy root-level `autoresearch-*` sessions and nested `autoresearch/autoresearch-*` sessions.

### Why
- Hook tasks are runtime-harness slices, not generic config edits. Agents need the exact route from adapter to `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh` before changing behavior.
- Codex adapter generation and Codex Settings trust are separate failure layers; confusing them makes hooks appear installed but inert.
- Autoresearch must remain agent-driven. Hooks may detect optimization intent or point to a session, but must not silently mutate or promote `SKILL.md` in the background.
- The hook workflow guard is intentionally small: it detects optimization language, points to the latest root or nested `autoresearch-*/session.json`, and reminds agents to run `record_experiment.py` for candidate edits.

### Verification Surface
- Autoresearch session: baseline 12/25 -> final 25/25, one kept candidate, no discarded candidates.
- The hook workflow regression is now represented in `evals/evals.json` rather than only in chat or the local session log.

## 2026-06-07 Autoresearch Hook Retirement

### Symptom
- User-level `~/.codex/hooks.json` and `~/.claude/settings.json` still registered `autoresearch-advisory.sh` on `PostToolUse Edit|Write` and `UserPromptSubmit`.
- `scripts/repo-harness.sh install` would reintroduce those entries even though public `assets/hooks` and route registry had already stopped shipping the hook.

### Fix
- Removed `autoresearch-advisory.sh` from self-host `.ai/hooks`.
- Removed autoresearch registration from `scripts/repo-harness.sh` and from the current user-level Codex/Claude hook configs.
- Tightened self-host hook parity so `.ai/hooks` must match `assets/hooks` without a dev-only autoresearch exception.

### Verification Surface
- `rg -n "autoresearch-advisory" .ai/hooks assets/hooks scripts/repo-harness.sh tests/workflow-contract.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts ~/.codex/hooks.json ~/.claude/settings.json`
- `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` covers prompt intent detection, session readback, and candidate edit reminders.

## 2026-05-06 Harness v2 Implementation Notes

### What Changed
- Runtime harness state is now local/ignored state, not a tracked product deliverable. The tracked source of truth stays in `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`, `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`, `.ai/harness/policy.json`, `.ai/context/context-map.json`, and `.ai/hooks/`.
- `tasks/research.md` remains the durable sidecar research store, but it is no longer root always-read context. The default root budget now covers routing, spec, todo, lessons, and policy; deep research is pulled on demand.
- `.claude/hooks/` is a shim surface only. Hook implementations and libraries live under `.ai/hooks/`; migration removes stale `.claude/hooks/hook-input.sh` and `.claude/hooks/lib`.
- `new-sprint.sh` creates a Draft plan and stops. `plan-to-todo.sh` remains the only path that turns an Approved plan into todo/contract execution state.
- `verify-sprint.sh` is the sprint-level evidence writer. `prompt-guard` done intent accepts only current-sprint checks with `status: pass`, `source: verify-sprint`, and matching contract/review paths.
- `SessionStart` resume injection now requires an active signal: orange/red context budget, executing plan/todo, blocker/dirty handoff, or a context-pressure resume reason. Bootstrap, idle, and acceptance-complete resume packets stay silent.

### Why This Fits The Harness Direction
- The harness should preserve context, enforce boundaries, recover state, and verify completion. It should not expand root context or invent duplicate runtime state surfaces.
- Codex auto-compact is treated as an unreliable fallback. The durable recovery path is explicit filesystem handoff plus fresh-session bootstrap.
- Claude and Codex both use hook-triggered automation through repo-local adapters that dispatch into `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`.

## 2026-05-06 Codex-first Waza Integration Notes

### What Changed
- Waza is now explicit Codex-first external tooling policy: `~/.codex/skills` is the Codex runtime source, while `~/.agents/skills` is only skills CLI staging/cache.
- The detector checks real host skill paths, symlink targets, per-skill versions, staging drift, and upstream stale status for the fixed Waza set: `check`, `design`, `health`, `hunt`, `learn`, `read`, `think`, `write`.
- `--check-updates` no longer shells out to `npx skills check`; it fetches upstream `tw93/Waza` raw `SKILL.md` files and compares hashes without mutating local skills.

### Validation Notes
- The local Codex Waza copies were synced from `~/.agents/skills` and verified with `cmp`.
- Fake HOME tests cover Claude symlinks to staging, Codex independent copies, source-lock divergence, and Codex stale drift reporting.

## 2026-05-11 Agentic Development Routing Notes

### What Changed
- Agentic task routing is now explicit policy, not only prose: product discovery routes to gstack `office-hours`, complex engineering plans to gstack `plan-eng-review`, design plans to gstack `plan-design-review`, and daily small/medium work to Waza `/think`, `/hunt`, and `/check`.
- P1/P2/P3 remains the shared due-diligence protocol underneath both gstack and Waza routes. It is explicit for `plan-eng-review`, `/hunt`, risky refactors, deployments, auth/payment/data work, and shared contracts; it stays internal for small local edits.
- Hooks should not infer semantic task intent. They continue to enforce workflow artifacts, contract state, and verification evidence only.

### What to Preserve
- Keep `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md` as the detailed routing contract so root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` stay concise.
- Keep host install/update detection in `external_tooling`; keep task routing in `agentic_development`.

## 2026-05-19 Minimal Docs, LSP Profiles, and Worktree Policy Notes

### What Changed
- Default scaffolding now uses `minimal-agentic` documentation: `docs/spec.md`, `docs/architecture/index.md`, `tasks/`, `.ai/harness/`, and a small reference-config set are required; `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/brief.md`, `docs/tech-stack.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/api/`, `docs/guides/`, `docs/archives/`, and the full reference-config corpus require explicit evidence or migration input.
- `docs/reference-configs/document-generation.md` is the reference for the new document boundary: generate the smallest skeleton, let the Agent decide when a domain doc is warranted, and keep generated placeholders out of default repos.
- `lsp_profiles` became explicit policy/context metadata. The root default is `typescript-lsp`; selected functional-block context entries can carry `lsp_profile`, `doc_scope`, and `verification_hint` without expanding root context.
- `worktree_strategy` became explicit policy. If the current repo state conflicts with the task, the agent should open an isolated `codex/<task-slug>` worktree, complete there, run Waza `/check`-style validation, and only merge back to `main` after checks pass.
- Init/migration external-tooling reports now skip update checks unless `REPO_HARNESS_CHECK_TOOLING_UPDATES=1` or the legacy `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CHECK_TOOLING_UPDATES=1` is set; update checks remain available but should be an explicit advisory action, not part of every scaffold/migration verification path.

### What to Preserve
- Keep `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json` and `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json` in sync whenever required files change.
- Keep reference-config installation profile-driven through `pi_install_reference_configs`; do not reintroduce unconditional `cp "$ASSETS_REF_DIR"/*.md`.
- Keep functional-block context selection explicit. Physical layout globs are hints only after a repo declares selected blocks.

## 2026-05-19 Notes, Evidence, and Asset Lifecycle Notes

### What Changed
- The workflow contract now has an explicit implementation-notes layer under `tasks/notes/`. `plan-to-todo.sh` creates one notes file per approved plan, and `archive-workflow.sh` archives that task-local explanation with the plan/todo/review artifacts.
- `verify-sprint.sh` now preserves raw evidence snapshots under `.ai/harness/runs/` while still updating `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json` as the current pointer.
- `.ai/harness/policy.json` now names the information lifecycle: task-local notes, raw verification evidence, promoted harness assets, and advisory memory.
- Handoff/resume surfaces now include active notes so long-running work can recover design decisions, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions without forcing those judgments into long-term memory.

### What to Preserve
- Keep `tasks/notes/` task-local. Archive it on workflow close; promote only repeated corrections, durable repo facts, or cross-task verified patterns.
- Keep raw run snapshots as evidence, not prose summaries. Reviews and future promotions should be checked against `.ai/harness/runs/` when available.
- Keep harness assets conservative: scripts, hooks, templates, workflow contracts, and reference configs should change only when a pattern has been verified beyond one local task.

## 2026-05-20 Capability-First Context Harness Notes

### What Changed
- `.ai/context/capabilities.json` is now the explicit source of truth for capability prefixes, local contract files, architecture modules, workstream directories, LSP profile, and verification hints.
- `scripts/capability-resolver.ts` owns longest-prefix matching. `agent-context-blocks.txt`, preferred `REPO_HARNESS_CONTEXT_BLOCKS`, legacy `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CONTEXT_BLOCKS`, and existing nested `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files are compatibility inputs only when the registry is absent.
- `architecture-drift.sh`, `context-contract-sync.sh`, and `workstream-sync.sh` now carry `capability_id` and `matched_prefix` fields while preserving `functional_block` for one compatibility cycle.
- Workstream sync writes to `.ai/harness/events.jsonl`; the separate `.ai/harness/workstreams/events.jsonl` surface was removed to keep event state atomic.
- Slice contracts now include `Capability ID`, while capability contracts remain the paired local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files.

### What to Preserve
- Do not reintroduce implicit `apps/*`, `packages/*`, or `services/*` context generation.
- Keep capability registry validation in `check-task-workflow.sh --strict`; stale prefixes should fail early instead of letting agents guess.
- Keep source and template mirrors aligned whenever resolver, drift, context-sync, workstream-sync, or workflow manifest files change.
- Keep `contracts` reserved for slice/capability workflow language. Runtime API schemas, event schemas, DTOs, and cross-boundary types belong under `interfaces/` when a scaffold needs a durable machine-consumed boundary surface.
- Keep root `specs/` as a legacy/explicit opt-in surface only. Default scaffolds should use `docs/spec.md` for stable product intent, `interfaces/` for runtime boundaries, and tests for executable behavior.
- Keep `docs/PROGRESS.md` as legacy-only. No default scaffold or strict workflow check should require it without a hook or event writer that owns it.
- Keep `tasks/notes/<slug>.notes.md` as a slice-local decision journal only. Root `AGENTS.md`, root `CLAUDE.md`, and generated agent partials should tell agents to use it for non-obvious decisions, deviations, tradeoffs, and open questions, not durable memory or task logging.
- Keep `_ref/` as an occasional ignored external reference checkout cache. It can be read or refreshed for upstream/source comparison, but it should not become a product edit, commit surface, or daily workflow; when a reference repo affects a decision, cite repo + commit/tag + path in the active notes or durable research entry.
- Keep `deploy/` as the commit-ready deployment and operations workspace for runbooks, submission materials, release checklists, helper scripts, ordered SQL files under `deploy/sql/`, and env examples. Keep `_ops/` fully ignored for local secrets, real env files, provider state, artifacts, logs, and scratch files.

## 2026-05-20 Contract Worktree Lifecycle Notes

### What Changed
- Contract-level tasks now have a deterministic helper lifecycle: `plan-to-todo.sh` detects policy-enabled contract tasks in the primary worktree and delegates to `scripts/contract-worktree.sh start --plan <plan-file>`.
- `contract-worktree.sh start` creates or reuses a `codex/<slug>` linked worktree, moves an untracked source plan into that worktree, writes ignored worktree metadata, and runs `plan-to-todo.sh` there with recursion disabled.
- `contract-worktree.sh finish` runs sprint verification, checks changed paths against the active contract when the hook library is available, commits the worktree branch, and fast-forwards the clean target worktree only after validation passes.
- Template-only repos do not always have `.ai/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh`, so `verify-sprint.sh` and `contract-worktree.sh` can fall back to the slug-matched `tasks/contracts/<slug>.contract.md` and `tasks/reviews/<slug>.review.md` files.
- `verify-contract.sh` now understands the generated contract template's `artifacts_exist`, `qa_scores`, and supported `manual_checks` criteria instead of treating those sections as command lines.

### What to Preserve
- Keep the primary worktree clean during contract execution. A copied untracked plan should live in the linked contract worktree so merge-back is not blocked by the task's own input artifact.
- Keep merge-back fast-forward-only and target-clean. If the target worktree contains unrelated or non-identical dirty files, `finish` must refuse to merge.
- Keep Waza `/check` as an external runtime validation step in prose/policy; do not vendor Waza skill contents into the project harness.

## 2026-05-20 Generated Router Entrypoint Notes

### What Changed
- Migration now installs `workflow-contract.ts`, `check-skill-version.ts`, `inspect-project-state.ts`, `migrate-workflow-docs.ts`, and a portable `migrate-project-template.sh` wrapper into generated repos.
- Generated helper scripts now resolve the upstream skill root from `AGENTIC_DEV_ROOT`, legacy `AGENTIC_DEV_SKILL_ROOT` / `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_ROOT`, or the new-first/legacy-second installed path candidates instead of assuming local `assets/`.
- `capability-resolver.ts` ignores local `.worktrees/` and `_ref/` directories during legacy discovery, preventing ignored contract worktrees and reference snapshots from polluting generated capability registries.

### What to Preserve
- Keep router entrypoints in the workflow contract helper inventory; downstream repos must be able to inspect, migrate, and verify themselves after the initial template sync.
- Keep source helper files and `assets/templates/helpers/` mirrors aligned whenever portability logic changes.

## 2026-05-20 Migration Idempotency Notes

### What Changed
- Repeated `migrate-project-template.sh --apply` on a clean committed generated repo no longer rewrites `.ai/harness/policy.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `.claude/.skill-version`.
- First-write policy and hook settings now go through the same JSON formatting path as later merge writes.
- Version stamps preserve `migrated_at` when `skill_version` and `template_version` are already current.

### What to Preserve
- Keep a regression test that commits the first migration output, runs apply again, and requires `git status --short` to stay empty.

## 2026-05-25 Default Brain Reference Config Externalization Notes

### What Changed
- Optional long-form `docs/reference-configs` files were copied into the default brain file vault under `icloud/brain/agentic-dev/*`.
- The repo copies of optional references now act as short stubs that point to default brain pages.
- `hook-operations.md`, `development-protocol.md`, and `evaluator-rubric.md` were partially externalized: repo-local files keep the shortest operational contract while full explanations moved to default brain.
- `.ai/harness/policy.json` now records `external_knowledge` separately from advisory memory so agents know the default brain is a recall layer, not a Hook runtime dependency.
- `.ai/harness/brain-manifest.json` is the repo-local index for externalized reference stubs, and `scripts/check-brain-manifest.sh` validates repo stub pointers, asset parity, maximum stub length, and local vault files when the iCloud brain path is mounted.

### What to Preserve
- Keep required minimal reference configs repo-local: `harness-overview.md`, `agentic-development-flow.md`, `external-tooling.md`, `sprint-contracts.md`, `handoff-protocol.md`, `document-generation.md`, and `global-working-rules.md`.
- Keep Hook runtime, workflow contracts, migration scripts, checks, and evidence in the repo. Do not make hooks query gbrain, iCloud, MCP, or default brain.
- Use `icloud/brain/<project>/*` for long-lived explanations, runbooks, decisions, references, and patterns that should be searchable across projects.
- Keep the brain manifest as a local contract and drift check only; missing iCloud vaults on other machines should not make generated repo workflow checks fail unless explicitly run with `--require-vault`.
- If optional reference docs grow again, put the long form in default brain and keep only a local pointer or minimal contract summary in `docs/reference-configs`.

## 2026-05-25 Agentic Dev Skill Installed Alias Notes

### What Changed
- `/Users/chris/Projects/agentic-dev` is now the only git-backed source repo and editable source of truth.
- `/Users/chris/.claude/skills/agentic-dev`, `/Users/chris/.claude/skills/project-initializer`, and `/Users/chris/.codex/skills/agentic-dev` are runtime symlinks to `/Users/chris/Projects/agentic-dev`.
- `/Users/chris/.codex/skills/agentic-dev-skill` and `/Users/chris/.codex/skills/project-initializer` are legacy Codex runtime aliases backed by source symlinks. They intentionally omit `SKILL.md` files and `assets/skill-commands/` so Codex discovery does not show duplicate `agentic-dev-*` command skills.
- Pre-migration Codex runtime copies were archived outside the skills root at `/Users/chris/.codex/source-migration-backups/agentic-dev-20260525-122534/`.
- Generated helper resolution without explicit root envs should prefer `/Users/chris/Projects/agentic-dev`, then runtime aliases and legacy fallbacks.

### What to Preserve
- Keep the resolver precedence source-first, then Codex/Claude runtime aliases, then legacy fallbacks.
- Keep `_ops/` protected during alias sync; it is local operations state and must not be overwritten or deleted by skill release commands.
- Keep the generated version stamp prefix legacy-compatible until a separate stamp migration changes the installed repo contract.

## 2026-05-25 agentic-dev Compatibility Rename Notes

### What Changed
- The skill/package/repo display name is now `agentic-dev`, formerly `agentic-dev-skill` and `project-initializer`.
- `SKILL.md`, `package.json`, README, root agent docs, product spec, OpenAI metadata, eval metadata, and default brain pointers now use `agentic-dev`.
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter keeps `agentic-dev-skill` and `project-initializer` in `when_to_use` metadata so legacy triggers remain discoverable while the canonical `name` is `agentic-dev`.
- The self-hosted default brain project path is `icloud/brain/agentic-dev/*`; `icloud/brain/agentic-dev-skill/*` and `icloud/brain/project-initializer/*` stay as legacy alias paths for redirects and older references.

### What to Preserve
- Keep legacy installed paths functional for one compatibility window even though new installed path candidates now exist.
- Keep only `/Users/chris/.codex/skills/agentic-dev` discoverable as a Codex personal skill; legacy Codex directories are resolver fallback bundles, not visible command surfaces.
- Keep generated version stamps using `project-initializer@{version}+template@{templateVersion}` for this compatibility window so already-installed repos do not fail version checks.
- Keep internal engine wording as `tasks-first harness` and contract ID `tasks-first-harness-v1`.
- Generated repos can now resolve the upstream skill with `AGENTIC_DEV_ROOT`, then legacy `AGENTIC_DEV_SKILL_ROOT` / `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_ROOT`, then `$HOME/Projects/agentic-dev`, then installed path candidates under `~/.codex/skills/agentic-dev`, `~/.codex/skills/agentic-dev-skill`, `~/.codex/skills/project-initializer`, `~/.claude/skills/agentic-dev`, `~/.claude/skills/agentic-dev-skill`, `~/.claude/skills/project-initializer`, `~/.agents/skills/agentic-dev`, `~/.agents/skills/agentic-dev-skill`, and `~/.agents/skills/project-initializer`.

## 2026-05-26 Context-Impact Research Delegation Notes

### What Changed
- Subagent and parallel-agent execution is now modeled as a main-agent decision based on task breadth, context impact, raw-log volume, and callable runner availability.
- `.ai/harness/policy.json` and generated policy writers now prefer `subagent`, `codex exec --json`, then a `main-thread trace` fallback for broad research/log scans.
- Codex handoff resume instructions now tell the next session to choose subagents, parallel sidecars, sidecar `codex exec --json`, or bounded main-thread research from context impact and callable tools without asking the user for spawn confirmation.
- Generated Claude/Codex orchestration partials now describe research delegation instead of unconditional subagent offload.

### What to Preserve
- Do not make correctness depend on Spawn/subagent availability. The main agent must be able to complete P1/P2/P3 research in-thread when tooling blocks delegation or spawning is not worth the context cost.

## 2026-05-28 Init CLI and Project-Initializer Retirement Notes

### What Changed
- `agentic-dev init` is now the operator-facing one-shot existing-repo bootstrap. It defaults the target repo to cwd, so callers already inside the project do not need `--repo .`.
- Init refreshes the installed `agentic-dev` skill aliases, installs global Codex/Claude hook adapters, applies the repo harness, bootstraps Waza skills (`check`, `design`, `health`, `hunt`, `learn`, `read`, `think`, `write`), syncs `diagram-design` into selected host skill roots when a source copy exists, and runs `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`.
- `project-initializer` is retired as an installed Codex/Claude skill path. `scripts/sync-codex-installed-copies.sh` removes `~/.codex/skills/project-initializer` and `~/.claude/skills/project-initializer` instead of maintaining them.
- Upstream runtime resolution no longer searches `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_ROOT` or `project-initializer` installed skill directories. `AGENTIC_DEV_ROOT` is canonical, and `AGENTIC_DEV_SKILL_ROOT` remains the only compatibility root env.
- Generated footer stamps now say `agentic-dev@{version}`; `.claude/.skill-version` keeps the stable `skill_version=` and `template_version=` fields.

### What to Preserve
- Keep `agentic-dev-skill` as the compatibility alias until a separate compatibility cutoff removes it.
- Keep CodeGraph, gstack, gbrain, provider setup, and daemon enablement outside automatic init; `agentic-dev init` owns Waza/diagram-design and host adapter setup only.
- Keep sidecar outputs concise and evidence-backed: conclusions and file/artifact paths belong in `tasks/research.md`; raw logs belong in harness evidence or local scratch surfaces.

## 2026-05-28 NPM Package Name Notes

### What Changed
- The npm package name and primary installed command are `repo-harness`.
- `agentic-dev` remains a compatibility bin alias for existing local workflows and installed references.
- `npx -y repo-harness init` is the intended one-shot command for existing repos once the package is published.
- Because `npx` runs packages from an npm `_npx` cache directory, `agentic-dev init` forces `AGENTIC_DEV_LINK_INSTALLED_COPIES=0` for those sources so Codex/Claude skill roots receive copies instead of symlinks to temporary cache paths.

### What to Preserve
- Do not use a personal npm scope for the public package name.
- Keep `agentic-dev` as a compatibility command alias and repo/product heritage name, while `repo-harness` is the primary CLI command and npm package name.
- Reset only the npm/CLI release line to `0.1.x`; keep `assets/skill-version.json` and generated project stamps on the `5.2.3` workflow compatibility line.
- GitHub repository metadata moved to `https://github.com/Ancienttwo/repo-harness`; npm package metadata should point at `git+https://github.com/Ancienttwo/repo-harness.git`.

## 2026-05-27 CodeGraph vs Understand Anything Research Notes

### Sources Checked
- `colbymchenry/codegraph` cloned into `_ref/codegraph` at tag `v0.9.5`, commit `318cda18d10266d58aaf14c54cf55fca1d39e6ed`; checked `README.md`, `src/bin/codegraph.ts`, `src/installer/targets/codex.ts`, `src/installer/instructions-template.ts`, and `src/mcp/tools.ts`.
- `Lum1104/Understand-Anything` cloned into `_ref/Understand-Anything` at tag `v2.3.1`, commit `ca5e3b8e21d611a129b27c6a0c24f15bab460ba0`; checked `README.md`, `.codex/INSTALL.md`, `understand-anything-plugin/hooks/hooks.json`, `understand-anything-plugin/skills/understand/SKILL.md`, and shell parser/config files under `understand-anything-plugin/packages/core/src`.
- Current tool availability was first validated at `0.9.5`; by the readiness hardening slice, npm `latest` and local `codegraph --version` both report `0.9.6`. After local pilot, `/Users/kito/.local/bin/codegraph` was created as a PATH-visible shim to the npm-installed CLI.
- Current repo shape: `rg --files -g '*.sh'` finds 82 shell scripts and `rg --files -g '*.ts'` finds 52 TypeScript files; `assets/hooks`, `.ai/hooks`, and `scripts` together include 74 shell files and 12 TypeScript files. Large shell pressure points include `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh` (1894 lines), `scripts/migrate-project-template.sh` (929), `.ai/hooks/hook-input.sh` (490), `scripts/context-contract-sync.sh` (431), `scripts/architecture-drift.sh` (394), and `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh` (391).

### Conclusion
- CodeGraph is the better fit for runtime agent exploration and affected-surface evidence because it is MCP/CLI-first, local SQLite-backed, AST-derived, and exposes `context`, `trace`, `callers`, `callees`, `impact`, `files`, `status`, and `affected` surfaces. Its installer supports Codex by writing `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, but Codex has no project-local config in CodeGraph `v0.9.x`, so this repo should avoid automatic installer writes. Human-facing setup should be one non-interactive terminal command, or an explicitly authorized agent action; `codegraph install --print-config codex` is diagnostic only.
- Understand Anything is the better fit for human-facing architecture comprehension, onboarding, domain views, and shell-heavy explanation. It supports `shell` via simple function/source extraction and generates `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` plus dashboard artifacts, but its pipeline is skill/multi-agent/documentation oriented rather than a low-latency hook/query substrate.
- Neither tool should replace `.ai/context/capabilities.json`, `tasks/workstreams/`, architecture requests, or workflow contract checks. CodeGraph is required Codex agent readiness for code navigation and P1/P2 discovery, while Understand Anything remains an advisory documentation/dashboard layer.

### Recommended Integration Boundary
- Keep the hook adapter invariant: `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` dispatch into `.ai/hooks/run-hook.sh`; do not add a second repo-local hook implementation tree.
- Do not use CodeGraph to rewrite shell guards. Use it as a required Codex agent code-navigation evidence provider around TypeScript and importable source paths: `codegraph status`, `codegraph sync`, `codegraph context`, `codegraph query`, `codegraph callers`, `codegraph callees`, and `codegraph impact`.
- Because CodeGraph does not support Bash/Shell as an indexed language in `v0.9.x`, shell-heavy guard semantics still need local file reads or a future TypeScript helper extraction path. Understand Anything can summarize shell scripts, but should not sit on the hot hook path.
- Add `.codegraph/` to ignored local state before any project initialization. Treat it like `.understand-anything/` if used: required agent read model for code navigation, not a committed workflow contract.
- Do not guide users to hand-edit MCP TOML. Use `npm install -g @colbymchenry/codegraph && mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && ln -sfn "$(npm config get prefix)/bin/codegraph" ~/.local/bin/codegraph && PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" codegraph install --target codex --location global --yes`, or let the user authorize their agent to run the equivalent.
- If a Codex launch environment cannot see `~/.local/bin/codegraph`, the authorized agent should diagnose `PATH` and shim placement. The fallback is not user-authored MCP TOML.

### Local Pilot Results
- Ran `npx -y @colbymchenry/codegraph@0.9.5 init -i .` after adding `.codegraph/` and `.understand-anything/` to local `.git/info/exclude`. It created `.codegraph/codegraph.db` only, about 1.9 MB.
- `codegraph status .` reported 53 files, 776 nodes, 1669 edges, WAL-backed `node:sqlite`, and only `typescript` (52 files) plus `yaml` (1 file). No shell files were indexed.
- `codegraph query findMatch --json`, `codegraph context "scripts/capability-resolver.ts findMatch match path prefix"`, and `codegraph callers normalizeRepoPath --json` were useful for the TypeScript capability resolver path, including line-level symbols and call relationships.
- `codegraph query architecture-drift --json` returned `[]`, confirming shell-heavy workflow scripts are invisible to CodeGraph.
- `printf 'scripts/capability-resolver.ts\n' | codegraph affected --stdin --filter 'tests/*.test.ts' --json` returned no affected tests even though `tests/capability-resolver.test.ts` exists. The likely reason is that this repo often tests scripts through process execution and path constants rather than import edges, so CodeGraph's import-dependency affected-test algorithm is not a reliable test selector here.
- `npm install -g @colbymchenry/codegraph@0.9.5` installed the package under `/Users/kito/.hermes/node/bin/codegraph`, but that bin directory is not on this Codex shell's `PATH`. The durable fix is a PATH-visible user-bin shim: `/Users/kito/.local/bin/codegraph -> /Users/kito/.hermes/node/bin/codegraph`.
- MCP smoke test with `codegraph serve --mcp --path .` successfully attached to a shared daemon for this repo after the shim was added; the temporary daemon was killed after the test.
- `codegraph install --print-config codex` produced only a global Codex config block for `~/.codex/config.toml`; it did not offer project-local Codex config.
- Temporary-HOME smoke test confirmed `codegraph install --target codex --location global --yes` creates `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; `--location local` skips Codex because CodeGraph `v0.9.x` does not support local Codex installation.
- `bash scripts/check-agent-tooling.sh --host codex --strict-readiness` now passes in this repo when CodeGraph CLI, Codex MCP config, and `.codegraph/` index are present; fake-env tests cover strict failure when Codex MCP is missing.

### Shell-Reduction Implication
- The next shell-reduction slice is not "replace hooks with CodeGraph" or "use CodeGraph affected as a test selector." The first useful slice is to move duplicated JSON parsing, slugging, and capability lookup out of shell guards into existing Bun helpers, then use CodeGraph only to reduce agent exploration around those helpers.
- A practical pressure point is `post-edit-guard.sh -> architecture-drift.sh -> capability-resolver.ts -> context-contract-sync.sh`. CodeGraph can help agents understand the TypeScript resolver/helper side, while a Bun helper can shrink repeated shell JSON and Markdown parsing.

## 2026-05-27 Architecture Event Helper Notes

### What Changed
- Added `scripts/architecture-event.ts` and template mirror `assets/templates/helpers/architecture-event.ts` as the first shell-reduction helper for the architecture drift hot path.
- The helper now owns architecture-event JSON field extraction, repo-relative path normalization, safe token derivation, fallback scope derivation, event JSON construction, and context-map updates.
- The helper now also owns context contract block rendering, active workstream summaries, latest snapshot/diagram lookup, and marker-based `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` replacement through `sync-contract-files`.
- `scripts/architecture-drift.sh` and `scripts/context-contract-sync.sh` call the helper on the normal Bun path while retaining compatibility fallbacks for older or partially installed repos.
- The helper is now part of `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`, `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`, and generated helper installation inventory.
- `bunfig.toml` now ignores `_ref/**`, `_ops/**`, `.codegraph/**`, and `.understand-anything/**` during test discovery so advisory reference checkouts and local read models do not poison `bun test`.
- After the latest `codegraph sync .`, CodeGraph reports 56 indexed files, 848 nodes, and 1,921 edges; `codegraph query architecture-event`, `syncContextMap`, `eventJson`, `render`, and `replaceContractBlock` now find the TypeScript helper surface.

### What to Preserve
- Keep `.ai/hooks/` as the shared hook implementation and shell adapters as thin dispatch/control-flow layers.
- Keep capability matching in `scripts/capability-resolver.ts`; `architecture-event.ts` should centralize adapter glue, not become a second capability registry.
- Keep `context-contract-sync.sh` responsible for command routing, capability re-resolution, and compatibility fallback only; new rendering logic should live in `architecture-event.ts`.
- Keep shell fallbacks until downstream generated repos have gone through at least one release cycle with `architecture-event.ts` installed by default.

## 2026-05-27 Passive Plan Capture Notes

### What Changed
- Added `scripts/capture-plan.sh` and template mirror `assets/templates/helpers/capture-plan.sh` so Codex Plan mode, Waza `/think`, and `agentic-dev-plan` outputs can be captured as timestamped `plans/plan-*.md` artifacts without requiring the user to remember `new-sprint`.
- The helper reads planning output from stdin or `--body-file`, fills a concrete Evidence Contract, extracts checkbox task breakdowns when present, writes `.ai/harness/active-plan` and mirrors `.claude/.active-plan` by default, and can run `plan-to-todo.sh` with `--status Approved --execute`.
- `.ai/harness/policy.json` now has a `plan_capture` section, and the helper is part of `assets/workflow-contract.v1.json`, `.ai/harness/workflow-contract.json`, generated helper installation, and scaffold/migration parity tests.
- Root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, generated partials, `agentic-development-flow.md`, and `agentic-dev-plan` now direct planning modes to capture decision-complete plans before implementation.

### What to Preserve
- Hooks may start a minimal Draft plan workflow for explicit Waza `/think` / Codex Plan intent, but they must not infer or rewrite the final assistant plan body from transcript text.
- Planning capture may write `plans/` plus the active-plan marker pair, but `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/contracts/`, `tasks/reviews/`, and worktrees should still wait for explicit implementation approval.
- `capture-plan.sh --execute` is the approved fast path only when the user has already approved implementation; otherwise leave the captured plan in `Draft`.

### 2026-05-27 Plan Approval Guard Regression

- Reproduced the missed trigger with `PROMPT='GO' bash .ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh`: before the fix it exited 0 with no `PlanStatusGuard`, while `PROMPT='开始实现'` and `PROMPT='执行'` both blocked on the missing active plan.
- Root cause: `prompt-guard.sh:is_implement_intent` recognized explicit implementation words but not terse approval prompts such as `GO`, so a common post-Think approval did not enter the plan gate.
- Fix boundary: recognize exact short execution approvals (`GO`, `go ahead`, `approved`, `proceed`, `ship it`, and selected Chinese approval phrases) as implement intent, but keep unrelated phrases such as `go over the docs first` non-blocking.
- Preserve the passive plan-capture invariant: the hook may create the initial Draft plan workflow on explicit plan-start intent, but final plan content still comes from the agent via `scripts/capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute`, and execution artifacts still come from `plan-to-todo.sh`.

### 2026-05-27 Approval Capture Bridge Correction

- Reproduced the current failure with `GO` after Waza `/think`: `UserPromptSubmit` runs before the assistant can execute the `/think` skill's `After Approval` instructions, so a hard `PlanStatusGuard` on exact approval prevents `scripts/capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute` from ever running.
- Root cause: the previous guard fix correctly detected terse approval, but overcorrected by treating exact approval as an implementation attempt instead of a handoff point where the agent must first capture/project the approved plan.
- Fix boundary: exact approval prompts (`GO`, `approved`, `可以干`, `直接改`, `整`, etc.) now emit a non-blocking `PlanCaptureGate` / `PlanExecutionGate` advisory so the assistant can run `capture-plan.sh` or `plan-to-todo.sh`; explicit implementation prompts such as `开始实现` remain hard-blocked when no active plan exists.
- Preserve the invariant that hooks do not parse assistant transcript text or write final plan content on prompt submit. The model/skill owns the exact plan body; scripts own artifact generation once invoked.

### 2026-05-27 Plan Start Bridge Correction

- User correction: the lifecycle should begin when Waza `/think` / Codex Plan starts, not only when the user approves implementation. Approval is a middle transition in an already file-backed planning workflow.
- Fix boundary: `prompt-guard.sh` now detects explicit planning starts (`/think`, `$think`, `plan this`, `出方案`, `怎么设计`, `写计划`, etc.) and, when no active plan exists, runs `scripts/ensure-task-workflow.sh --slug <derived> --title <derived>` to create a Draft `plans/plan-*.md` artifact immediately.
- Guardrail: bug-hunt language (`bug`, `报错`, `修复`, `崩溃`, etc.) suppresses the plan-start bridge so debugging prompts do not create planning artifacts by accident.
- The hook still does not generate contracts/reviews/todo/worktrees on plan start; those remain approval/execution artifacts created by `capture-plan.sh --status Approved --execute` or `plan-to-todo.sh`.

### 2026-05-27 Approval Intent Variant Correction

- Reproduced the residual gap after 5.2.2 with a temporary generated workspace: `GO` and `可以干` reached `PlanCaptureGate`, but `go ahead with it` hard-blocked under `PlanStatusGuard` and `可以干了` exited 0 without any capture/projection guidance.
- Root cause: `prompt-guard.sh:is_execution_approval_intent` was intentionally anchored to whole approval utterances, but its alternation only listed bare tokens such as `go ahead` and `可以干`; natural suffix variants therefore diverged between hard-blocking and silent no-op paths.
- Fix boundary: expand only anchored approval variants (`go ahead with it`, polite `proceed`, `可以干了`, etc.) in `.ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` and the `assets/hooks/` mirror, while preserving broad bug/fix implementation wording as a hard `PlanStatusGuard` path instead of an approval capture shortcut.
- Regression coverage now exercises both no-active-plan capture and approved-plan projection for natural approval variants, plus a negative case for `go ahead with the bug fix`.

### 2026-05-29 Claude Plan Review Intent Boundary

- Reproduced the user habit where Claude produces the first plan and Codex is asked to refine/review it: a prompt starting with `你来完善一下Claude这个方案` can include pasted plan metadata such as `/think`, `Done`, `execute`, `ExitPlanMode`, and `我想加一个功能`.
- Root cause: `prompt-guard.sh` stripped XML context blocks but did not recognize the first-line plan-review/refinement wrapper, so full-body keyword scans treated copied plan content as new-feature, implementation, or done intent and routed to `ResearchGate`, `PlanStatusGuard`, or `ContractGuard`.
- Fix boundary: first-line plan refinement/review intent now suppresses implementation, done, plan-creation, and plain-feature plan-start classification. Direct execution prompts such as `开始实现` still hard-block without an approved active plan.
- Regression coverage: `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` pins Claude plan refinement/review prompts with pasted execution metadata as non-blocking planning review while preserving the neighboring implementation and approval guards.

## 2026-05-27 Default Brain Document Sync Notes

### What Changed
- Added `scripts/sync-brain-docs.sh` and template mirror `assets/templates/helpers/sync-brain-docs.sh` for one-way repo-to-brain mirroring.
- Sync is opt-in per `.ai/harness/brain-manifest.json` entry via `sync.direction=repo-to-brain`; pointer-only externalized stubs remain check-only so existing long-form brain files are not overwritten by short repo stubs.
- `post-edit-guard.sh` now calls `scripts/sync-brain-docs.sh --changed <path>` after edits, so only the edited manifest-registered source file can be mirrored.
- `scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict` runs `scripts/sync-brain-docs.sh --check` to detect drift for opted-in entries when the local brain vault is available.
- The self-host repo now opts in `docs/reference-configs/agentic-development-flow.md`, `docs/reference-configs/harness-overview.md`, and `docs/reference-configs/external-tooling.md`; these were synced to `icloud/brain/agentic-dev/references/`.

### What to Preserve
- Do not auto-sync arbitrary docs or all `docs/**`; sync must remain manifest-controlled and one-way from repo source to default brain.
- Do not make hook correctness depend on `gbrain`, MCP, or querying the default brain. The hook may write exact opted-in files and should remain non-blocking.
- Keep repo-local contracts, hooks, scripts, checks, and evidence authoritative; brain files are durable advisory knowledge, not the active workflow source of truth.

## 2026-05-28 Active Plan / Todo / Review Semantics Correction

### What Changed
- `.ai/harness/active-plan` is now an explicit per-worktree selector only; `.claude/.active-plan` remains a legacy mirror, and runtime helpers no longer treat the latest `plans/plan-*.md` as the implicit active plan.
- `.ai/harness/active-worktree` records the owning worktree path whenever `capture-plan.sh`, `plan-to-todo.sh`, or `switch-plan.sh` selects an active plan.
- `tasks/todo.md` is a deferred-goal ledger only. Active implementation checkboxes stay in the selected plan's `## Task Breakdown`; `plan-to-todo.sh` creates contract/review/notes and updates the plan status without copying those tasks into todo.
- Hook execution no longer blocks implementation because `tasks/todo.md` is not sourced from the active plan. It requires the active plan plus contract/review/check evidence instead.
- `contract-worktree finish` keeps active markers long enough for verification, then removes local runtime markers before scope checks and commit/merge.
- Review templates and guard messages now make review completion a post-verification Waza `/check` step.

### Why
- A single global active plan turns Draft planning into a repo-wide lock, which conflicts with the worktree-first contract model.
- Repeating plan breakdowns in `tasks/todo.md` creates two mutable execution ledgers that can drift; medium/long-term deferred goals need different metadata: reason, tradeoff, and revisit trigger.
- Reviews are evaluator evidence, not planning scaffolding. They should be filled after verification, then used by done gates together with `.ai/harness/checks/latest.json`.

### Verification
- `bun test tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts tests/workflow-contract.test.ts tests/migration-script.test.ts tests/bootstrap-files.test.ts tests/create-project-dirs.runtime.test.ts tests/agents-assembly.test.ts tests/scaffold-parity.test.ts tests/output-parity.test.ts tests/readme-dx.test.ts tests/cli/init.test.ts`
- `bun test`
- `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`
- `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`
- `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`
- `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`
- `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`

## 2026-05-28 Hook Protocol Compliance Fix (PreToolUse exit-code semantics)

### Symptom
- Claude Code surfaced `PreToolUse:Edit hook error / Failed with non-blocking status code: No stderr output` whenever a guard tried to block an edit (e.g. `ContractScopeGuard` rejecting an out-of-scope file). The model could not see the reason, retried the same edit, and the user saw an opaque error.

### Root Cause
- Every block-intent path in `pre-edit-guard.sh`, `worktree-guard.sh`, and `prompt-guard.sh` exited with `exit 1` and wrote the diagnostic + structured JSON to stdout via `hook_structured_error`.
- Claude Code's hook protocol only treats `exit 2` as a true block (stderr is what gets fed to the model). Any other non-zero exit is a non-blocking status code, and the helper text was on stdout, so stderr was empty — hence "No stderr output".

### Fix
- `hook_structured_error` (`.ai/hooks/hook-input.sh`, mirrored in `assets/hooks/`) now mirrors `[guard] reason` and `Fix: ...` to stderr when `action=block`, while still emitting the existing telemetry JSON on stdout for trace/log consumers.
- Every block-intent `exit 1` was replaced with `exit 2` (4 sites in `pre-edit-guard.sh`, 1 in `worktree-guard.sh`, 18 in `prompt-guard.sh`).
- Tests: new `tests/hook-protocol.test.ts` pins exit 2 + stderr contents for `WorktreeGuard`, `ExternalReferenceGuard`, `OpsPrivateGuard`, `ContractScopeGuard`, `PlanTransitionGuard`, `PlanStatusGuard`, `ContractGuard`, and the `hook_structured_error` dual-channel contract. Existing assertions in `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` and `tests/bootstrap-files.test.ts` were updated from `exit 1` to `exit 2`; stdout/JSON telemetry remains unchanged for backwards compatibility.

### Known Adjacent Bug (Not Fixed Here)
- `workflow_contract_allows_path` compares the (potentially absolute) `tool_input.file_path` against contract `allowed_paths` patterns that are repo-relative (e.g. `.ai/hooks/`). An absolute path like `/Users/.../agentic-dev/.ai/hooks/foo.sh` never matches, so `ContractScopeGuard` falsely blocks edits to allowed directories. During this fix the workaround was to temporarily move `.ai/harness/active-plan` and `.claude/.active-plan` aside. Real fix should normalize `FILE_PATH` to a repo-relative path before scope matching (see `pre-edit-guard.sh:53-64`). Tracked as a follow-up.

### Verification
- `bun test` (431 pass, 6 skip, 0 fail)
- Manual repro: `echo '{"tool_name":"Edit","tool_input":{"file_path":"_ref/upstream/README.md"}}' | bash .ai/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` now exits 2, with `[ExternalReferenceGuard] ...\n  Fix: ...` on stderr and the original telemetry JSON on stdout.
- `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`, `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`, `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`, `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`, `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`.

## 2026-05-28 Hook File-Path Normalization Fix (ContractScopeGuard / repo-relative pattern matchers)

### Symptom
- ContractScopeGuard falsely blocked edits to files inside `allowed_paths` directories whenever Claude Code passed an absolute `tool_input.file_path` (the default). `.ai/hooks/` was listed in the contract yet `/Users/.../agentic-dev/.ai/hooks/foo.sh` was still reported as "outside the allowed_paths".
- ExternalReferenceGuard / OpsPrivateGuard silently failed on absolute paths (e.g. `/repo/_ref/foo.md` did not match the `_ref/*` shell case). post-edit doc-drift / brain-sync matchers had the same silent failure.

### Root Cause
- `workflow_contract_allows_path` and the `case` patterns in `pre-edit-guard.sh` / `post-edit-guard.sh` are repo-relative (e.g. `.ai/hooks/`, `_ref/*`, `apps/*/src/...`). Hooks read `tool_input.file_path` verbatim from Claude Code, which always sends absolute paths. Shell `==` glob match never matches a repo-relative pattern against an absolute path.

### Fix
- New helper `hook_normalize_file_path` in `.ai/hooks/hook-input.sh` (mirrored to `assets/hooks/`):
  - Returns the input unchanged for empty / relative / non-`HOOK_REPO_ROOT` paths.
  - Strips the repo-root prefix (and the canonical `pwd -P` form for macOS `/var → /private/var` symlinks) when the path lives inside the repo.
  - Resolves the parent directory's realpath so the canonical prefix still strips even when the target file does not exist yet.
  - Leaves paths outside the repo absolute so out-of-scope detection still triggers.
- `hook_get_file_path` now routes every return path through `hook_normalize_file_path`.

### Tests
- `tests/hook-protocol.test.ts` gained three regression tests:
  - Absolute path inside the repo to `_ref/...` still triggers ExternalReferenceGuard with exit 2.
  - Absolute path outside the repo remains absolute and trips ContractScopeGuard with exit 2.
  - Absolute path under an allowed_paths directory exits 0 (no false block).
- `bun test` 434 pass / 6 skip / 0 fail.

### Verification
- Manual repro 1 (was failing): `echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"/Users/.../agentic-dev/.ai/hooks/sample.sh"}}' | bash .ai/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` → exit 0.
- Manual repro 2 (regression guard): `echo '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"/Users/ancienttwo/.claude/plans/some-other-file.md"}}' | bash .ai/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` → exit 2 with the ContractScopeGuard stderr message intact.
- `bash scripts/check-deploy-sql-order.sh`, `bash scripts/check-task-sync.sh`, `bash scripts/check-task-workflow.sh --strict`, `bun scripts/inspect-project-state.ts --repo . --format text`, `bash scripts/migrate-project-template.sh --repo . --dry-run`.

## 2026-05-28 Hook Contract Boundary Fix (host plan files outside repo)

### Symptom
- With an active sprint contract, `pre-edit-guard.sh` blocked host/runtime plan writes such as `/Users/ancienttwo/.claude/plans/*.md` as outside `tasks/contracts/init-cli-external-skills.contract.md`.
- The same failure shape repeated as a task-level blocker because repo-local `ContractScopeGuard` was acting like a global filesystem lock.

### Root Cause
- `hook_normalize_file_path` correctly leaves paths outside `HOOK_REPO_ROOT` absolute, but `pre-edit-guard.sh` still applied `workflow_contract_allows_path` to every `FILE_PATH`.
- A repo contract's `allowed_paths` are repo-relative and should govern only paths in the current repo. Host plan files and scratch files are outside this repo's ownership boundary.

### Fix
- `.ai/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` and `assets/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` now apply `ContractScopeGuard` only when the normalized file path is repo-scoped, meaning non-empty and not absolute.
- Repo-internal paths still normalize to repo-relative and remain contract-checked; repo-external absolute paths bypass only the repo sprint contract, not the host's own hook or OS/filesystem protections.

### Verification
- Manual repro: `printf '%s' '{"tool_input":{"file_path":"/Users/ancienttwo/.claude/plans/repro-hook-block.md"}}' | bash .ai/hooks/pre-edit-guard.sh` now exits 0.
- Regression guard: `bun test tests/hook-protocol.test.ts` covers repo-internal contract blocking, repo-internal absolute normalization, repo-external boundary bypass, and allowed absolute paths.

## 2026-05-28 Prompt Done-Intent Noise Filter Correction

### Symptom
- A copied continuation prompt containing an approved plan body was blocked by `ContractGuard` for the unrelated active contract `tasks/contracts/init-cli-external-skills.contract.md`.
- The prompt was a normal implementation request; literal words like `Completed` and Chinese phrases around future completion appeared inside plan/test text, not as a declaration that the current sprint should be marked done.

### Root Cause
- `prompt-guard.sh:is_done_intent` scanned the whole `PROMPT_INTENT_TEXT` for broad tokens (`done`, `complete`, `completed`, `finished`, `完成`, `结束`, `收工`).
- Claude/Codex UserPromptSubmit payloads can include copied AGENTS/plan/context text before the user's actual task, so whole-payload substring matching turns documentation and plan content into done intent.
- A first-pass fix tightened long prompts and ASCII token boundaries, but the short-prompt CJK branch still matched any `完成` substring, so instructions like `完成后验证这段 CLI 行为` could still close the active contract.

### Fix
- Long or plan-shaped prompts must declare done on the first non-blank line with an explicit completion command.
- Short prompts now require ASCII token boundaries and explicit Chinese completion phrases (`完成了`, `任务完成`, `结束吧`, `收工`, etc.); future-work phrasing such as `完成后验证` no longer triggers `ContractGuard`.
- `prompt-guard.sh` invokes `verify-contract.sh --read-only` from the done gate so transient hook-driven verification failures do not rewrite the contract status and dirty the worktree.

### Verification
- Regression tests cover a long plan-style prompt with literal `Completed`, a short `completionToken` substring, and a short Chinese `完成后验证...` task instruction.
- `verify-contract --read-only` tests cover both strict pass and strict fail without rewriting the contract `Status` header.

## 2026-05-29 Prompt Diagnostic Intent and Worktree Ownership Transfer

### Symptom
- Diagnostic prompts such as `为什么 hook 没开 wt 去执行？` were routed through `prompt-guard.sh:is_implement_intent` because the Chinese `执行` token was matched anywhere in the prompt.
- Stale or foreign active-plan markers turned ordinary implementation prompts into repeated hard blocks, even when the selected plan file was missing from the current worktree or owned by another linked worktree.
- When an approved captured plan projected through `capture-plan.sh --execute`, `plan-to-todo.sh` started a linked contract worktree and moved the untracked plan there, but the primary worktree kept `.ai/harness/active-plan`, `.claude/.active-plan`, and `.ai/harness/active-worktree` pointing at the moved or missing primary-side plan path.

### Root Cause
- `is_implement_intent` had an execution keyword gate but no diagnostic-question exclusion for hook/worktree/root-cause wording.
- `prompt-guard.sh` relied on `get_active_plan`, which intentionally returns empty when markers are stale, but it did not distinguish "no workflow exists" from "marker exists and is invalid/foreign".
- `contract-worktree.sh start --plan <plan>` copied the plan into the linked worktree and removed untracked primary copies, but did not transfer active marker ownership away from the primary worktree.

### Fix
- `prompt-guard.sh` now treats hook/worktree/root-cause/debug questions as diagnostic intent unless they are explicit approval, embedded approved-plan prompts, or plan-shaped Markdown.
- `prompt-guard.sh` now downgrades stale or foreign active-plan markers to advisory output, clears the invalid primary markers, and leaves true no-plan implementation prompts hard-blocked.
- `workflow-state.sh` now records whether the active marker is deleted or owned by a different worktree, so shared consumers can distinguish absent workflow state from rotten marker state.
- `contract-worktree.sh` now clears primary active markers when either primary active-plan marker points to the plan being transferred; the linked worktree still writes its own active markers through `plan-to-todo.sh`.
- Mirrors updated: `.ai/hooks/`, `assets/hooks/`, `scripts/contract-worktree.sh`, and `assets/templates/helpers/contract-worktree.sh`.
- Adjacent verification drift was fixed in generated-project tests: CodeGraph policy assertions now expect `primary_host=both` and `required-for-agent-code-navigation`, matching `scripts/lib/project-init-lib.sh`.

### Verification
- `bun test` covers diagnostic execution questions, stale/foreign marker self-heal, capture/worktree marker transfer, generated CodeGraph policy expectations, and migration idempotence.

## 2026-05-30 Review/Check Prompt Guard Boundary

### Symptom
- Codex `UserPromptSubmit` blocked a review/check prompt with `PlanStatusGuard` even though the prompt only asked to prepare or run evaluator evidence, for example `验收开始：基于 active plan 执行 checklist，告诉对方模型验收什么。`
- The observed session came from Codex Plan mode: a Draft `plans/plan-*.md` existed, but no active-plan marker selected it yet, so the user's follow-up question lost planning state before the hook classified the prompt.
- The Codex Hooks summary also showed raw `{"guard":"PlanStatusGuard",...}` telemetry because the dispatcher mirrored failing hook stdout into stderr.
- A copied assistant status snippet such as `plan-to-todo 已按项目规则开了隔离 worktree... 实现会在这个 worktree 里完成。` could also be classified as implementation intent when pasted without the surrounding human question.

### Root Cause
- `prompt-guard.sh:is_implement_intent` treated any `execute` / `执行` token as implementation intent before separating review/check/release routing, so "执行 checklist" and "执行 Waza /check" entered the implementation gate and hit the missing active-plan block.
- `run-hook.sh` captured Codex failure status after the `if` compound command instead of in an `else` branch, so failing hooks returned success in direct repro; on failure it also mirrored structured telemetry JSON to stderr.
- Passive worktree status lines were not modeled separately from user execution requests, so the word `实现` inside an assistant progress sentence could hit `PlanStatusGuard` in a primary worktree with no active marker.

### Fix Boundary
- Review/check/release prompts now route through a dedicated advisory intent unless they contain explicit coding verbs such as `implement`, `实现`, `开始写`, `动手`, or `开干`.
- Direct implementation approvals and bug-fix implementation prompts still enter the plan gate.
- Codex non-`SessionStart` hook failures now preserve the real exit status and filter structured telemetry JSON from user-facing stderr while keeping direct hook stdout telemetry unchanged for trace consumers.
- Passive worktree status snippets are now non-implementation context, while explicit execution starts such as `开始实现` still hard-block without an active plan.

## 2026-05-30 ResearchGate UserPrompt Boundary

### Symptom
- A discussion prompt after Codex Plan state loss was hard-blocked by `ResearchGate` because `tasks/research.md` was older than the latest Draft plan.
- The hook fired before the agent could explain the stale Plan-mode state or decide whether fresh research was actually needed.
- When `tasks/research.md` was fresh, the same discussion shape could still trigger hook-driven Draft plan creation because `is_think_plan_start_intent` matched planning words before excluding diagnostic questions.

### Fix Boundary
- `ResearchGate` is now advisory on `UserPromptSubmit`: stale research prevents hook-driven automatic Draft plan creation, but it no longer exits 2 or emits structured block telemetry.
- Diagnostic continuation prompts now short-circuit plan creation/refinement/start classifiers, so "继续讨论 / 为什么 / hook / plan 怎么设计" stays conversational instead of mutating `plans/`.
- Implementation and done paths still keep their hard gates; the relaxed boundary only applies to semantic plan-start detection before any tool mutation.

## 2026-05-30 Pending Plan Orchestration Capture Boundary

### Map
- Runtime path remains `UserPromptSubmit -> .ai/hooks/run-hook.sh -> .ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh`; host planning UIs are transient and repo authority remains `plans/plan-*.md` plus `.ai/harness/active-plan`.
- New transient bridge is `.ai/harness/planning/pending.json`, configured by `.ai/harness/policy.json` `planning.pending_orchestration_file` and mirrored in generated assets.
- `PlanDiscussionGate` is advisory only. `PlanCaptureGate` is non-blocking capture guidance only when a fresh pending marker exists and no active repo plan is selected.

### Trace
- A `$think` / plan-start prompt creates a Draft plan through `scripts/ensure-task-workflow.sh --new-plan` and records pending orchestration metadata: host, kind, prompt slug, optional Draft plan path, and source ref.
- Follow-up discussion prompts with plan/workflow/hook context and refinement/question language do not start another Draft plan and do not enter implementation gates.
- Explicit implementation prompts with a fresh pending marker return `PlanCaptureGate` and instruct the main agent to run `scripts/capture-plan.sh`; stale pending markers fall back to the original hard `PlanStatusGuard`.
- `scripts/capture-plan.sh` and `scripts/plan-to-todo.sh` clear the pending marker after successful capture/projection.

### Decision
- The pending marker is intentionally not an active-plan substitute. It only represents "host/thread planning is still being discussed or needs capture."
- Bug-fix implementation prompts still use the hard plan gate, even if stale planning context exists, because a pending design discussion is not evidence that a bug-fix plan was approved.
- `SessionStart` injects pending capture context so Codex resume/compact does not force the user to remember that the plan body still needs to be captured.

## 2026-05-30 Leading Skill Link Plan Slug Boundary

### Symptom
- A Waza `/think` prompt written as a leading markdown skill link could create plan artifacts with a slug like `think-users-ancienttwo-agents-skillsthink-skill-md`.
- The repeated name came from the original prompt-derived slug and then propagated through plan, contract, review, archive, and current-status artifacts; it was not an active-plan marker selecting that stale Draft.

### Root Cause
- `prompt-guard.sh:derive_plan_start_title` stripped leading punctuation before collapsing `[$think](...)` to `think`. After the leading `[$` was removed, the markdown-link regex no longer matched and the local skill path became part of the title and slug.

### Fix Boundary
- Collapse Waza think skill links before trimming leading punctuation in both `.ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` and `assets/hooks/prompt-guard.sh`.
- Keep the active-plan authority unchanged: `.ai/harness/active-plan` still selects executable plan state; an old Draft file by itself does not become active work.

## 2026-05-29 Contract Worktree Done/Archive Split

### Symptom
- Contract worktree completion had two competing terminal paths: a user `done` prompt could trigger `.ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` AutoArchive inside the linked worktree, while `scripts/contract-worktree.sh finish` verified, committed, and fast-forward merged without archiving the plan.
- In the primary worktree with no active marker, terse approval prompts still correctly fail with `PlanStatusGuard`; an empty Draft plan file is not an executable approved plan.
- Handoff generation and task progress hints still had legacy `tasks/todo.md` reads, even though current execution checklists live in the active plan `## Task Breakdown`.

### Root Cause
- `.ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` treated all done intents the same after quality gates passed and did not distinguish primary worktree from linked contract worktree.
- `scripts/contract-worktree.sh finish` owned the contract worktree merge path but did not call `scripts/archive-workflow.sh`, so the archive lifecycle was outside the only command that can safely commit and merge the terminal state.
- Multiple hook/handoff surfaces computed "next task" independently, which made `/check`, `finish`, and cleanup recommendations drift from the actual contract state.

### Fix
- `.ai/hooks/lib/workflow-state.sh` now owns `workflow_plan_task_state` and `workflow_next_action`; the stage order is active plan task -> `/check` -> `finish` -> `cleanup` -> none.
- Done intent inside a linked contract worktree now emits `[WorkflowNextAction]` from the shared helper and does not call AutoArchive.
- `contract-worktree finish` now captures the active plan, runs `verify-sprint.sh`, checks contract scope, archives the completed workflow, clears local runtime markers, commits, and fast-forward merges.
- `contract-worktree cleanup --slug <slug>` removes only merged linked worktrees, deletes merged branches with `git branch -d`, and removes local metadata from the target primary worktree; it refuses unmerged branches, dirty linked worktrees, and linked-cwd invocation.
- Primary non-contract worktree AutoArchive remains for compatibility.
- The empty Draft `plans/plan-20260529-0105-think-hook-capacity-wt.md` was moved to `plans/archive/` as Superseded housekeeping rather than treated as an executable plan.

### Verification
- `bun test tests/workflow-state-lib.test.ts tests/hook-runtime.test.ts tests/helper-scripts.test.ts tests/create-project-dirs.runtime.test.ts tests/migration-script.test.ts` covers shared next-action helper presence, handoff output, finish-time archive before merge, cleanup safety, generated policy cleanup_script, and linked-worktree done intent producing the finish next action without archive.

## 2026-05-29 File-Prefix Workstream Sync Closeout

### Symptom
- The architecture request for `.ai/harness/policy.json` recommended `scripts/workstream-sync.sh ensure --block ".ai/harness/policy.json" --request ...`.
- `scripts/capability-resolver.ts match` already resolved `.ai/harness/policy.json` to `workflow-engine-contract-assets`, but `workstream-sync.sh` and `context-contract-sync.sh` rejected the same path because their local `validate_block` functions required `[[ -d "$block" ]]`.

### Fix
- `scripts/workstream-sync.sh` and `scripts/context-contract-sync.sh` now accept existing repo-relative files or directories as capability blocks, matching the resolver's longest-prefix behavior.
- The template mirrors under `assets/templates/helpers/` were updated with the same validation rule.
- The `.ai/harness/policy.json` request was resolved without a new snapshot: `worktree_strategy.cleanup_script` is a policy contract field owned by `workflow-engine-contract-assets`; runtime cleanup remains owned by `scripts/contract-worktree.sh`.

### Verification
- `tests/hook-runtime.test.ts` includes a file-prefix workstream-sync fixture for `.ai/harness/policy.json`, checking the generated workstream and projected local contract block.

## 2026-05-31 Repo Harness Env Alias Migration

### Boundary
- `REPO_HARNESS_*` is now the preferred runtime environment prefix for scaffold, migration, context-block, external-tooling, and contract-worktree control knobs.
- Existing `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_*` variables remain compatibility fallbacks so installed repos and old automation do not break during the rename window.
- Upstream root discovery is unchanged: `AGENTIC_DEV_ROOT` remains canonical and `AGENTIC_DEV_SKILL_ROOT` remains the compatibility root env; retired `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_ROOT` stays out of runtime resolution.

### Trace
- Shell scaffold/migration paths read env through `pi_env_value` and `pi_plan_type`, then flow into `create-project-dirs.sh`, `init-project.sh`, `migrate-project-template.sh`, `plan-to-todo.sh`, and `contract-worktree.sh`.
- Context selection paths read `REPO_HARNESS_CONTEXT_BLOCKS*` before `PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CONTEXT_BLOCKS*` in both shell selectors and `scripts/capability-resolver.ts`.
- Generated context maps now advertise `REPO_HARNESS_CONTEXT_BLOCKS` plus `legacy_env=PROJECT_INITIALIZER_CONTEXT_BLOCKS` instead of presenting the legacy env as the primary selector.

### Preserve
- New generated `.gitignore` runtime blocks and Codex resume packets write `repo-harness` markers.
- Keep dual-read support for old generated markers such as `managed by project-initializer` and `generated-by: project-initializer` until downstream repos have migrated.

## 2026-06-06 Prompt Guard Plan Consultation False Positive

### Symptom
- Consultation/status prompts that mentioned `new plan` / `创建计划` / `方案` plus implementation words such as `动手` could reach `PlanStatusGuard` and block with `No active plan found in plans/.`
- A representative false positive was a long Codex/Think status report beginning with `Think 应该选择哪个方案` and saying `没分清之前我不动手`; the negated execution word was still enough for the broad implementation classifier.

### Fix
- `.ai/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` and `assets/hooks/prompt-guard.sh` now share `is_plan_consultation_intent`, which requires both a plan/hook term and consultation/question wording, and excludes explicit execution starts.
- Plan consultation now short-circuits implementation, plan creation, plain feature plan-start, Waza think plan-start, and BDD injection paths.

### Verification
- `bun test tests/hook-runtime.test.ts -t "prompt-guard"`
- `bun test tests/cli/prompt-guard-decision.test.ts`
- Manual temp-repo UserPromptSubmit repro of the long Think/Graph renderer prompt exits `0` without `PlanStatusGuard`.
