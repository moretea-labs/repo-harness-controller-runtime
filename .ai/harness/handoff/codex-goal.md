# Codex Goal

## Source of truth

- PRD: `plans/prds/20260619-1729-repo-harness-document-governance.prd.md`
- Checklist Sprint: `plans/sprints/20260619-1803-document-governance-phase-1-truth-repair.sprint.md`

## Role

Codex is the executor. ChatGPT/repo-harness may prepare planning artifacts, but implementation ownership stays in the local Codex session.

## Scope

- Open or use an isolated worktree for the sprint implementation.
- Execute the checklist Sprint task cards in order.
- Update the Sprint checklist as phases complete.
- Stage each completed phase before continuing to the next phase.
- Do not modify the reference repo or ignored secrets/ops state.

## Required workflow

1. Read the PRD and Sprint paths above before editing.
2. Build the P1/P2/P3 map required by repo-local AGENTS.md for non-trivial changes.
3. Execute one checklist task card at a time.
4. After each phase, run the relevant focused checks, update the checklist, and stage the completed slice.
5. Continue until the Sprint checklist is complete or a real blocker is reached.
6. Leave a concise handoff with staged state and verification evidence.

Execute only Phase 1. Read plans/plan-document-governance-phase-1-truth-repair.md first. Repair the current status snapshot, regenerate current handoff and then resume, write an explicit latest check result, run the strict workflow check, update the checklist, stage the coherent result, and stop. Keep historical documents and product source unchanged.

## Required checks

- Run the checks named by the Sprint task card.
- At sprint closeout, run repo-required checks unless the Sprint narrows the verification surface with a stated reason.

## Done when

- The checklist Sprint is complete.
- Every completed phase is staged.
- Checks pass or failures are documented with exact blocker evidence.
- No commit is created unless the user explicitly asks for commit.
